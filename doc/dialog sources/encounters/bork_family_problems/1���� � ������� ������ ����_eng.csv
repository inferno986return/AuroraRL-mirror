0;Cap? Captain? *Sarah knocks on the camera lens with her finger. The camera shakes.;engineer_dialog;;
;Frontz, quit it. The equipment is fragile, you'll break it.;1;;
1;This thing, fragile? *laughs* You can kill a cow with that. I'm serious, you can.;engineer_dialog;;
;I believe you. Is there anything else?;2;;
2;There is. *She nods.* Let me show you. *Sarah presses some button, and the previously quiet radio is instantly filled with dense Bork cursing. You can see Frontz laughing heartily, though she has turned off her microphone. She returns the communication line back to normal in a few seconds.*;engineer_dialog;;
;So, what was it?;3;;
3;This is what's on all of our comm lines. Some Borks are negotiating. They don't think it's necessary to encode it, of course. You can hear it from whichever end of the system.;engineer_dialog;;
;Give them to me again. I want to know what they're talking about.;6;;
;This is very useful information, Sarah. Veeeery useful. I'll get right to writing up a report about putting you forward to a decoration. Let's say, umm... Order of the Galaxy. ;4;;
;Thanks for the information, Sarah, but I'm not interested. Over and out.;-1;;1
4;Does it even exist?;engineer_dialog;;
;For you, I'll make it happen.;5;;
5;Without looking too far into the future, I'll say: why an order? *She smiles.* I'll settle for a medal.;engineer_dialog;;
;If there's one thing I love about you, Frontz, it's how modest you are. Right. Over and out.;-1;;1
6;Sure, Cap. Just don't make a sound! If you can hear them, they can hear you.;engineer_dialog;;
;Got it. Okay, do it.;7;;
7;*There is another click, Sarah types something quickly, configuring something. As a result, you can hear the Borks much better now. You now realize that there are two voices, even though they're very similar.* Mine! It's mine! I deserve it more!! NO, MINE! ME! MINE!;engineer_dialog;;
;*listen some more*;8;;
8;*It's hard to say what the next sentence means. The translator can't handle it, and instead of coherent speech you hear barbaric noises of the Bork language. That must have been some especially convoluted insult. After that, there are no problems with the translation.* You're asking for it! I'll tear you apart! *The other voice responds immediately.* I'M OLDER! I'VE ALWAYS BEATEN YOU!;;;
;*listen some more*;9;;
9;*The first voice yells back instantly.* I still remember that! My ship is better! BUT DAD HAD THE BEST SHIP! Yeah! And that's why I want it! I REMEMBER! HE LEFT NOTE! IT SAYS SHIP IS MINE! He couldn't write! Arrr! ARRRRRRR! Arrrrrrrr! ARRRRRRRRRRRRR! *Those Bork cries certainly don't mean anything good. If you don't intervene, there will be a fight.*;;;
;*keep silent*;10;;
;Hello? Do you read me?;13;;
10;*The line goes silent. Apparently the brothers are fighting.*;;;
;So the aliens have inheritance problems, too.;11;;
11;Did you say anything, Cap?;engineer_dialog;;
;Nothing. Thinking out loud. And Sarah, please stop listening in on my personal line.;12;;
12;*Sarah smiles and signs off.*;engineer_dialog;;
;*Sigh, pour a little wine in a glass, complain about how hard it is to be a Captain, and get to other business.*;-1;;1
13;AHUH?! WHAT? Shut up. Hey. Who are you? How did you… oh. Did you turn off the encoding of our comms again, you retard? WHAT'S ENCODING? Shut up. Okay. Who are you and what are you doing on our line?;;;
;Who am I? I'm… hmm… I'm God. Yeah.;14;;
;Just passing by.;37;;
;I'm your dad. Who else?;63;;
;Nobody. I'm already leaving. You guys keep fighting.;-1;;1
14;UH. WHAT'S A GOD? Uhhhh… yeah. What's a God?;;;
;You don't know? God is the omnipotent, supernatural higher creature. Well, that's me.;15;;
15;OMNI… SUPER… SUPER… BLAH! *The other voice is silent.*;;;
;Basically, it means that I'm more powerful than the two of you put together.;16;;
16;WHAT?! NO ONE'S STRONGER THAN ME! I'M STRONGER THAN EVERYBODY STRONG AND EVEN THE STRONGEST ONES! TELL ME YOUR NAME?!! WHO ARE YOU?!! WHAT ARE YOUR POWERS?!!;;;
;Buddha. I'm, like, eternal, and all that. And I also have a bit of a weight problem.;17;;
;Allah. Yeah, I'm stronger than you. And I'm good with explosives. There was a time when I was good at science, but now… I'm good with explosives.;18;;
;Jesus (Catholic). Well… I'm good at taking punches in the cheek. And I like kids.;19;;
;Jesus (Orthodox). Well… I'm good at taking punches in the cheek. And I like money.;20;;
;Jesus (Protestant). Well… I'm good at taking punches in the cheek. And I like money. And I like mortifying flesh… my own, unfortunately. But that won't save you two. ;21;;
;Jesus (Mormon). Well… I'm good at taking punches in the cheek. And I like stupid people. Oh boy, you can't even imagine how much I like stupid people!;22;;
;Krishna. I don't even know what else to say. I'm good at singing. And I can sing for a long time.;24;;
;Satan. While you obeyed your daddy, I tried to punch mine out. Didn't end too well, but how cool was that!;27;;
;Thor. Well, uh… the power of the lightning! Woooo!;32;;
;Seth. I have a jackal's head. Although you probably don't know what a jackal is…;33;;
;Tetragrammaton. Everything is permitted to me. And I really - did you hear? - REALLY like money.;34;;
;The Obliterator. In fact, I don't think you can call me a god. But I'm strong.;36;;
;My name is L. Ron Hubbard… and this is a really long story. It's about religion, or a science, called Scientology. Seriously, you won't get it.;78;;
17;ETERNAL?! WHAT DOES HE MEAN?! You're dumb. He says he's, like, immortal. OH YEAH?! I'LL KILL HIM THEN. Me too. *The line goes dead.*;;;
;Right. Well, let's say I tried. Henry, we have a battle alert.;-1;;
18;BLOW ME UP?! ME?! HAHAHAHA. I'LL WRECK YOUR SHIP AND CHOKE YOU!! He'll be dead already. DOESN'T MATTER. *The line goes dead.*;;;
;Stupid Borks. No respect for other cultures. Well… Liszkiewicz, battle alert. Ready the guns.;-1;;
19;WHAT DO KIDS HAVE TO DO WITH IT?! I didn't get that, either. It sounded weird… I think he thinks we're stupid. ME?! I'LL KILL YOU! Go ahead, I'll help you. *The line goes dead.* ;;;
;Amen. Henry, we're going to have a fight. Battle alert.;-1;;
20;MONEY?! TAKE MY MONEY?! YOU… ARRRRRRRR! *He signs off.* Whoever you are, you're done for. When this retard gets angry, you better hide. And when I get angry, you better save me the trouble and kill yourself.;;;
;No respect for the faithful. Henry, turn the weapon systems on. We're going to have a battle.;-1;;
21;MORTIF… MORT… ARRRRRRR! *Having lost his faith in the world, the stupider brother launches an attack. The smarter one signs off as well and attacks you.*;;;
;Right. Henry, we're going to have a battle.;-1;;
22;WHAT?! I DIDN'T GET THAT. He said he, like, likes you. IS HE CALLING ME STUPID?!! Yes. ME?! STUPID?! And a complete retard. And he also said that- ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! *The line goes dead.*;;;
;I don't think they believed me. Although, the people of Earth didn't, either… These Borks are smarter than they look. Right, Henry?;23;;
23;*Henry, who has been listening in on the line for a good while now as he's supposed to do, responds.* Yes, Captain. According to the radar, they're going to attack.;marine_dialog;;
;Well, then, battle alert. Not like we have a choice, is it?;-1;;
24;HUH?! SING? HM… *The Bork sniffs quietly.* SING. I LIKE SINGING. Are you out of your mind?! SHUT UP. I WANT TO HEAR A SONG.;;;
;As you wish. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. I can do it some more: Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare. Did you like it?;25;;
25;*The Bork processes the lyrics for a couple of seconds. And then he pipes up boomingly.* WHAT THE... ARRRRRRRRRRRR! *He signs off and launches an attack, according to the radar.* You're weird. But I'll be happy to kill you, *concludes the second voice.* ;;;
;Just as I thought, they didn't like it. Henry, battle alert.;26;;
26;Sounded several seconds ago, Captain. *Henry responds because he, as he should, has been on the emergency line for a good while now.* How do you know the lyrics to that mantra?;marine_dialog;;
;Oh, don't ask. I think we better get ready for a fight. Hare ha… Damn it, now I can't stop singing it.;-1;;
27;PUNCHING YOUR DAD?! OOOOH. THAT'S BRAVE. *The voice booms approvingly.* WHO WAS YOUR DAD?;;;
;He created the place where we lived. And he had a whole bunch of friends. When I tried to punch him out, some of his friends wanted to help me... Well, it's a long story. But trust me, I didn't have a choice.;28;;
28;AND WHAT NOW?;;;
;And now my dad and I aren't on good terms. Although they say he still loves me. I'm his son, after all.;29;;
29;YEAH. HEY, SMART GUY... WE'RE SONS OF OUR DAD, TOO. *The second voice is cautious.* What do you mean by that? HE LOVED US TOO. HE DIDN'T WANT US TO FIGHT. He called you stupid, and me a dumbass. YEAH, HE LOVED US. HE WAS GOOD. Could be. What do you suggest? I DON'T WANT DAD'S SHIP. I WANT TO GO HOME TO MOM. SHE LOVES ME TOO. Right. So... I can take the ship? *The first voice is silent. According to the radar, its owner has jumped out of the system.* Right. Satan, I don't know who you are, but thanks. You got rid of that retard. What a laugh.;;;
;You're always welcome. Satan is always there to help, one could say.;-1;;
;Eh, no. I want that ship, too.;31;;
31;You won't get it!;;;
;Your funeral. Liszkiewicz, battle alert!;-1;;
32;*The line goes dead. Apparently, the Borks are attacking. Obviously, they decided not to grace your idiotic drivel with an answer.* ;;;
;Henry, we're going to have a fight.;-1;;
33;I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. Me neither. BUT I'LL KILL YOU ANYWAY. For the first time ever I agree with you, Brother. *The line goes dead.*;;;
;Right… Those things happen. Liszkiewicz, battle alert!.. Damn it. I feel like a total idiot.;-1;;
34;THERE'S FEAR IN YOUR WORDS!! KILL!! KILL!! KILL!! *He signs off.* Tetragrammaton? What kind of name is that?! *According to the radar, they're both going to attack.*;;;
;Henry, battle alert. Hmmm… Sarah? Are you on my line again?;35;;
35;Cap, that was something! Tetragrammaton?! *Sarah shows her pearly whites.*;engineer_dialog;;
;Well, I had to surprise them, didn't I? Also, stop eavesdropping. Someday I'll transfer you back to Earth for that. Over and out.;-1;;
36;HA. YOU'RE NOT HIM. YOU'RE TOO SMALL. Yeah. Itty bitty, in fact. LIKE A SPECK OF DUST. A speck of sand. HAHAHAHAHA! Hahahaha! *The line goes dead, and suddenly, you hear Sarah's voice.* Small? Cap, what were they talking about? *She smiles mischievously.*;;;
;Nothing. Nothing at all. Damn it! They're attacking!! Liszkiewicz, battle alert! Frontz, uh… grab onto something!;-1;;
37;What do you want?! YEAH. WHY ARE YOU LISTENING IN?;;;
;What's the deal here? I'm curious.;38;;
38;And why did you... *The louder and dumber one talks over his smarter brother.* WE HAD A DAD. STRONG. AND YEAH. HE DIED RECENTLY. AND HIS SHIP, WHOA, GOOD! OOOH! ARRRR! Why are you... AND HE WANTS IT. I WANT IT TOO. AND I NEED IT MORE. No, I do! NO!!;;;
;You're ready to kill each other over a regular ship?;39;;
39;NOT REGULAR! GOOD! DAD'S! And in fact, that ship is far from bad, *the smarter brother concludes.*;;;
;Far from bad? I think I need it more.;40;;
;Uh… look, fratricide isn't normal. Let me try to help you decide, at least.;41;;
;Yeah, I get it. Well, go on, then. Sorry for interrupting you.;-1;;
40;OH YEAH?! TRY TO TAKE IT! Yeah, you try it! *The lines goes dead, the Borks attack.*;;;
;Henry, battle alert! Power to weapon systems!;-1;;
41;AND WHO ARE YOU?! Yeah! Although… *The smarter brother thinks for a bit.* That's reasonable. In any case, if something happens, we can take this fool out together. HEY! MAYBE WE'LL TAKE YOU OUT TOGETHER INSTEAD!;;;
;You Borks are so sweet. I promise to be impartial.;42;;
42;*They don't respond. They must be waiting for a speech.*;;;
;Okay. You, with the loud voice. Why do you think you have to get the ship?;43;;
;All right. You, the one who isn't completely stupid. The smart guy. Why do you need the ship?;46;;
;Tell me more about your father. What was he like?;48;;
;I think I've made a decision.;49;;
43;HA. DAD LOVE ME! WHEN HE HIT ME, HE HIT ME IN THE HEAD. ONLY ONE BONE, SO IT DOESN'T HURT! AND THE SMART GUY GOT IT IN THE SPINE. AND HE LOVE MY MOTHER, NOT THIS SMARTASS'S. HE WAS LIKE ME. AND THIS SMARTASS ALWAYS THROWS HIS WEIGHT AROUND. HIS ROCKETS MUST ONLY BE ONE METER LONG!;;;
;What's wrong with a meter long rocket?;44;;
44;WEAK. A NORMAL BORK NEVER HAS ROCKETS LESS THAN TWO METERS LONG. WHAT KIND OF ROCKETS DO YOU HAVE?!;;;
;Ahem… Trust me, they're big. But let's not talk about that right now. What else can you say?;45;;
45;*The alternatively gifted Bork shuts up, giving you the floor.*;;;
;Okay. You, with the loud voice. Why do you think you have to get the ship?;43;;
;All right. You, the one who isn't completely stupid. The smart guy. Why do you need the ship?;46;;
;Tell me more about your father. What was he like?;48;;
;I think I've made a decision.;49;;
46;Haaar! *The Smart Guy roars. Even though his voice isn't as deep as his brother's, it still sounds like a deafening roar.* What is this idiot going to do with a great ship? He'll probably go rob Klisks or the Zorsan. He'll die in the second raid, if not the first one. But I can use it intelligently, I'm not exactly stupid. And after all, Dad loved me more. For one thing, my mother had two kids, so we're both smart. And Dad, even though he was like this one... *The dumber brother roars.*...he never called him anything except Stupid. And me, he called me affectionately... *did he just shed a tear?* Dumbaaaass!;;;
;So your brother is going to rob and pillage. Aren't you?;47;;
47;Yeah, me too. *He's smart, but simple. Or is being simple a kind of being stupid?* It's just that I'll just be smart about it! *The Smart Guy keeps silent, waiting for your decision.*;;;
;Okay. You, with the loud voice. Why do you think you have to get the ship?;43;;
;All right. You, the one who isn't completely stupid. The smart guy. Why do you need the ship?;46;;
;Tell me more about your father. What was he like?;48;;
;I think I've made a decision.;49;;
48;STRONG! BRAVE!! KILLED MANY KLISKS!! KILLED MANY ZORSAN!! I have to agree. Dad was stupid, but don't let anyone tell you he didn't know how to fly a ship. HE WASN'T DUMB! HE WAS LIKE ME! Well, that's what I'm talking about... YOU'RE ALWAYS BEING ARROGANT. REMEMBER HOW DAD BEAT YOU OVER THE SPINE WHEN WE WERE KIDS? He beat you over the head! YEEEAAH... GOOD TIMES... *The Borks have a strange concept of family love.* ;;;
;Okay. You, with the loud voice. Why do you think you have to get the ship?;43;;
;All right. You, the one who isn't completely stupid. The smart guy. Why do you need the ship?;46;;
;Tell me more about your father. What was he like?;48;;
;I think I've made a decision.;49;;
49;WELL?! What is it?!;;;
;The dumb one, you get the ship. You need it more.;61;;
;Smart Guy, you can take the ship. You'll handle it better.;62;;
;Why do you have to fight over it? Can't you settle it peacefully?;50;;
;Neither of you deserve the ship. I'll take it.;40;;
;You know what? Settle it yourselves. Judging idiots is too hard.;-1;;1
50;*The Borks are silent, letting you finish.*;;;
;You're brothers, after all. Would your father really want you to kill each other over his ship?;51;;
;Handle the ship together. A pilot team of two brothers, it's great!;55;;
;Why do you have to make it so hard? Take the ship apart and divvy up the spare parts. I think it's a wise decision.;56;;
;Settle it using some other bet. For example, who robs the most goods in a month. Whoever wins gets the ship.;57;;
;Why do you even need that ship? Let it be a monument to your father. Or send it into the star. No ship, no problem.;58;;
;Sell the ship, divide up the money.;60;;
51;*The Bork breathe heavily.* HE'S RIGHT, SMARTASS. DO YOU REMEMBER HOW DAD BEAT YOU? I do. You won't shut up about it. I can't pull that trigger now, Stupid. I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOU EITHER, DUMBASS. But... what about the ship? I... you know... you take it. Maybe Dad really wanted it like that. NO. YOU TAKE IT. IT'S BETTER. Oh come on now. I've made a decision. I don't need Dad's ship. I SAID TAKE IT! No, you take it! YOU'RE ASKING FOR IT!!;;;
;Easy, easy. If neither of you want to take the ship, I can sort that problem out.;52;;
52;REALLY? YOU'LL TAKE IT?!;;;
;It's not an easy decision, but… what can I do?;53;;
53;ARRR! GOOOOD!! I feel stupid, but… arrrrr! *The smart brother signs off and flies towards the border of the system. The stupid brother signs off as well and quickly follows him.*;;;
;That was really weird. Um… Henry, did you hear that? REALLY weird.;54;;
54;Borks, Captain. Just Borks. *Henry smiles cunningly looking at the camera.*;marine_dialog;;
;That's true. Right… Okay. Over and out. We have to go on. Great things await us.;-1;;1
55;IT'S TOO SMALL. Yeah. Dad's ship is too small to fit both of us. If that's your decision, it didn't help us. Stupid, get ready for battle. We don't have a choice. ARRRRRR! *They sign off and attack each other.*;;;
;Too bad I couldn't do it.;-1;;1
56;Taking apart a great ship like that?! Dad would… YEAH. DAD WOULDN'T WANT IT. Your decision didn't help us. Right. We don't have a choice. *The line goes dead. According to the radar, the Borks are attacking each other.*;;;
;Too bad. But I tried.;-1;;1
57;That's dumb. We'll be too busy for it. AND SMARTASS IS GOING TO COME HERE AND STEAL THE SHIP. Or someone else is. Your decision didn't help us. It's too bad that we have to do it, but... *The line goes dead. The Borks attack each other.*;;;
;But it doesn't make any sense! Damn it. I couldn't do it.;-1;;1
58;THIS... THIS... DECISION. Are you... serious? I... No, I... *The smart one thinks.* Sounds good to me. Really good. I don't want to shoot you, Stupid. I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU EITHER, DUMBASS. HEY. YOU. THANKS FOR YOUR HELP. Yeah, thanks. It's a strange decision, but it's better than... Arrrrr! *The line goes dead. A couple of seconds later, their father's ship flies off towards the star, and the Borks fly off towards the system border.*;;;
;I think I can be proud of myself.;59;;
59;Yeah, Cap, you're so sweet! I'm proud of you!;engineer_dialog;;
;Don't be a flirt, Sarah. And stop listening in on my personal line. Although… thanks for calling me sweet. But stop listening in on the captain's line regardless! Over and out.;-1;;2
60;DAD SAID WE COULDN'T SELL THE SHIP. Yeah. He said it would be disrespectful. Is this your decision? It didn't help us... *The smart guy sighs, which sounds like a quiet roar.* Well, then. We have to do it, Stupid. *The line goes dead. The Borks start fighting.*;;;
;Damn it. I couldn't do it.;-1;;1
61;ARRRR! SEE?! SEE?!!! IT'S MINE!! MIIIINE!! Yeah, I saw. I won't fight the two of you, but... You, whoever you are. I'll find you. And I'll have my revenge. *The line goes dead. The smart one flies off towards the border of the system. His brother does something with his father's ship.*;;;
;Um… I hope he'll forget about it. And in any case, this solution is better than nothing. Although I could have done better.;-1;;3
62;Har! Good decision. The ship is in good h- *The alternatively gifted brother's roar drowns him out.* YOU! ME!!! I!!! KILL!!! *After a moment he yells even louder.* LATER!!! LAAAAAAATER!!! *The line goes dead. The smart guy stays next to his father's ship. His brother goes towards the border of the system.*;;;
;Um… I hope he'll forget about it. And in any case, this solution is better than nothing. Although I could have done better.;-1;;4
63;DAD! YOU'RE ALIVE! Shut up, stupid. He's not Dad. He's lying. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?!!! DAD, YOU'RE ALIVE!! IT'S GREAT!! Retard, *the smart Bork states.* And you... aaaaar! If you're our father, come on, tell us about yourself. Who were you?;;;
;A merchant. Who else?;64;;
;A military man. I'd battle with whoever I was ordered.;65;;
;A pirate. I robbed whoever I wanted.;67;;
;I… well, I solved problems. Didn't matter whose as long as they had money. The Klisk, the Zorsan, the Rogues… those newfangled humans. Diplomacy, random shuffles, agent work.;66;;
64;ARRRRRRRRRRR! YOU!!! *The line goes dead. The brothers approach the Aurora 2, and they don't mean well. Well, apparently their dad didn't like trading much.*;;;
;Henry, Battle alert! Right. Worth a try.;-1;;
65;DAD?!! FOR THEM?!! ARRRRR! *The line goes dead. The brothers attack. You must have made a mistake.*;;;
;I had to try… Liszkiewicz, battle alert! Power to weapon systems!;-1;;
66;WHAT?! YOU'RE NOT DAD! *The line goes dead, the brothers attack. No, seriously, did you really think you guessed that right?*;;;
;No, I made a mistake. Uh… who am I talking to? Right. Doesn't matter. Liszkiewicz, battle alert!;-1;;
67;DADDY!! Shut up! Lots of Borks are pirates. He's lying! NO!! HE'S NOT!! Yes he is!;;;
;You, the dumber one, shoot this smartass up. Let him shut up.;70;;
;I really am your father. I'm a pirate Bork, arrrrrrr!!! Arrrrrr!!!;68;;
;Hey. Don't you recognize me? Don't you remember how we used to play when you were little? It's me!;69;;
68;DAD NEVER ROARED LIKE THAT! Whew… do you get it now? *The line goes dead. The Borks attack.*;;;
;I had to try. Henry, power to weapon systems. There's going to be a fight.;-1;;
69;ARRRRRRRR!!! YOU'RE NOT DAD!! YOU LIED!! You see now?! Played when you were little... Yeah, right! His favorite game was hitting you with a stick!! *The line goes dead. The brothers approach the Aurora 2, and they don't mean well.*;;;
;I was so close. What a shame… Liszkiewicz, battle alert.;-1;;
70;DAD!! I'M DOING IT!! You retard, don't do it! Don't! Right, Daddy, I recognize you now, just tell him not to shoot at me!;;;
;Go on. It's his punishment for not recognizing me.;71;;
;Stupid, stop it. Giving him a scare is enough.;72;;
71;YOU!! *The Bork roars disappointedly.* DAD WOULDN'T SAY THAT!! Whew… And now let's kill this liar. OKAY!! *And they launch an attack. You should probably get ready.*;;;
;That's right. Henry, battle alert.;-1;;
72;OKAY, DAD!!! YEAH!! *The smart one lets out a relaxed sigh, or rather a roar.*;;;
;Right, then. Get your asses out of here before I get angry.;75;;
;All right. Hand over your cargo and get out of here. Let's call it help from my sons.;74;;
;Great, then. Now make peace.;73;;
73;WHAT?!! ARRRRR!!! Didn't I tell you?! YOU'RE NOT DAD!!! YOU LIED, YOU LIED!!! WHY DID YOU DO IT?!!! *The Borks attack.*;;;
;Too bad. I was so close… Battle alert! Liszkiewicz, I repeat! Get ready for battle!;-1;;
74;YOU BETTER HAND OVER YOUR CARGO, NOT-DAD!!! YOU'RE NOT DAD!!! DAD NEVER TOOK OUR CARGO!!! Finally you get it, retard. *The Bork ships quickly approach the Aurora 2. Their intentions are obvious.*;;;
;Um, Henry… There's going to be a fight! Get ready!;-1;;
75;YEAH, DAD!!! And what about the ship?!;;;
;I get the ship. Because it's mine. Stupid, give the dumbass a kick, let him get a move on.;76;;
76;*It must be hard when your brother is not only dumber than you, but also stronger. Your radar tells you that the Bork ships are moving towards the edge of the system, and then jump. Only their father's ship is left, unmoved. Rightful booty.*;;;
;Well, I did it. I was good, right?;77;;
77;Ooooh yeah, Cap! You sure were!;engineer_dialog;;
;Sarah… Thanks, but if you listen in on my personal line again, I'll cut your pay. You know I'll do it. Go take care of your direct responsibilities. Over and out.;-1;;5
78;TELL US OR FIGHT US. Ron? Hubbard? What kind of name is that?;;;
;It's a long story… ahem… Let's start off with saying that there once was a creature called Xenu. He was the overlord of the Galactic Empire. It existed seventy-five million years ago.;79;;
;Let's cut the chit-chat. En garde!;-1;;
79;WHAT?! What empire?!;;;
;That doesn't matter, trust me. What does is that he was a very, very cruel emperor. Many citizens of his empire weren't content with his rule.;80;;
80;WHAT?!! What empire? I've never heard about it! What kind of name is that?! You're trying to cheat us!!;;;
;No, I'm not. Although... anyway, listen on. There were a lot of protesters. Almost two hundred billion. He took them all to my home planet, killed them with hydrogen bombs, and their souls... uh... how do I put this... he put them into the bodies of the creatures that are now called humans.;81;;
81;WHAT?!! What is this drivel?! What's a soul?!;;;
;Don't interrupt! I'm not finished. Now we're getting to the basics. These free souls that inhabited those creatures' bodies are called thetans. The goal of every thetan is becoming an operating thetan. An operating thetan is a thetan that is capable of acting independently from material things. I don't really understand what it is myself, to be honest... but nevermind. This is not the essence of Scientology.;82;;
82;*The Borks are silent, awestruck after what you just told them.*;;;
;I'm glad you're listening so attentively. So. There are different kinds of operating thetans. Fifteen levels. The higher your level, the more of an operating thetan you are. And being an operating thetan, like I already told you, is wonderful, since an operating thetan doesn't need physical things to act. Does this sound vague to you? That means I've done it!;83;;
83;WHAT?!! ARRRR! Um… and how do you reach those levels?;;;
;It's good that you ask! The levels are reached very easily. Those who want to reach them have to hand me over all of their belongings and money. Well, not to me directly, but... actually, you could say it goes to me.;84;;

;If you're not saying no, it means yes, right? I know, it's hard for you to accept the truth about the real nature of things, but... trust me, it's worth it. Of course, it's bad to be homeless, penniless, and have no family... but imagine how it is to be a level five operating thetan! Not many people have enough money for more. So, can you dig it? Do you want to hand me all of your money and cargo?;85;;
85;WHAT?!! NOOO! ME DON'T UNDERSTAND! Me… me… me either…;;;
;Oh, that means we're not done yet. I'm always glad to explain it to you again. Well, then… listen up.;86;;
;Who cares, anyway. We've gone off topic. I need your father's ship, so I'm attacking. En garde!;-1;;
86;WHAT?! No, wait, that's not what we meant…;;;
;Again, let's start off with saying that there once was a creature called Xenu. He was the overlord of the Galactic Empire. It existed seventy-five million years ago.;88;;
88;ARRRRRRRRRRR!;;;
;He was a very, very cruel emperor. Many citizens of his empire weren't content with his rule.;89;;
89;What is this BS?! What is it?! Ron Hubbard, are you crazy or something?!;;;
;Listen on. There were a lot of protesters. Almost two hundred billion. He took them all to my home planet, killed them with hydrogen bombs, and their souls... uh... how do I put this... he put them into the bodies of the creatures that are now called humans.;90;;
90;I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. THETANS?! XENU?! WHAT?! HOW?!;;;
;These free souls that inhabited those creatures' bodies are called thetans. The goal of every thetan is becoming an operating thetan. An operating thetan is a thetan that is capable of acting independently from material things. I don't really understand what it is myself, to be honest... but nevermind. This is not the essence of Scientology.;91;;
91;Stop it! Stop!!;;;
;There are different kinds of operating thetans. Fifteen levels. The higher your level, the more of an operating thetan you are. And being an operating thetan, like I already told you, is wonderful, since an operating thetan doesn't need physical things to act. Does this sound vague to you? That means I've done it!;92;;
92;WHAT?! What?!;;;
;The levels are reached very easily. Those who want to reach them have to hand me over all of their belongings and money. Well, not to me directly, but... actually, you could say it goes to me.;93;;
93;*The Borks are silent. Obviously, they are being graced with the truth.*;;;
;If you're not saying no, it means yes, right? I know, it's hard for you to accept the truth about the real nature of things, but... trust me, it's worth it. Of course, it's bad to be homeless, penniless, and have no family... but imagine how it is to be a level five operating thetan! Not many people have enough money for more. So, can you dig it? Do you want to hand me all of your money and cargo?;94;;
94;NOOOOOO!!! You're crazy! You're just out of your mind!;;;
;Got it. Let me start again, then.;95;;
;Who cares, anyway. We've gone off topic. I need your father's ship, so I'm attacking. En garde!;-1;;
95;*The Borks respond with a wild roar*;;;
;Do you remember? Xenu. He was the overlord of the Galactic Empire. It existed seventy-five million years ago.;96;;
96;I DON'T WANT!! I DON'T!! Enough!! Enough!!!;;;
;He was a very, very cruel emperor. Many citizens of his empire weren't content with his rule. You haven't forgotten this, right?;97;;
97;AAAAARRR! How could we have forgotten?! You said that a minute ago!!;;;
;Glad to hear it. Listen on, then.There were a lot of protesters. Almost two hundred billion. He took them all to my home planet, killed them with hydrogen bombs, and their souls... uh... how do I put this... he put them into the bodies of the creatures that are now called humans.;98;;
98;*The dumb brother cries in misery and, judging from the sounds, hits the dashboard with his head. His smarter relative is silent, but he's breathing much more loudly and heavily.*;;;
;These free souls that inhabited those creatures' bodies are called thetans. The goal of every thetan is becoming an operating thetan. An operating thetan is a thetan that is capable of acting independently from material things. I don't really understand what it is myself, to be honest... but nevermind.

99;I… I CAN'T… I CAN'T HANDLE IT ANY MORE… Me… me neither…;;;

100;THE LEVELS. YOU HAVE TO TELL US ABOUT THE LEVELS. Yeah. There was something about them.;;;
;I see you want to hear some more! The levels are reached very easily. Those who want to reach them have to hand me over all of their belongings and money. Well, not to me directly, but... actually, you could say it goes to me.;101;;
101;*The Borks are silent again.*;;;

Do you want to hand me all of your money and cargo?;102;;
102;I… NOT EXACTLY. TELL THE STORY AGAIN. Yeah… tell us. I think I see some sense in this.;;;
;Oh. I see you've almost become level one operating thetans! Congratulations! I'm always glad to tell this wonderful story again.;103;;
103;TELL US ABOUT XENU. WHO IS HE?;;;
;He was the overlord of the Galactic Empire. It existed seventy-five million years ago.;104;;
104;*The dumb brother is silent, and his brother asks a question.* It must have been a great empire, and Xenu must have been very powerful, if people still remember it?;;;
;Of course it was a great empire! And about Xenu… he was powerful, but he was a very, very cruel emperor. Many citizens of his empire weren't content with his rule.;105;;
105;YEAH. AND THEN HE'S LIKE, POW! POW!! GREAT JOB, XENU! GREAT JOB!;;;
;I'm shocked and amazed that my teaching has reached your soul! Listen on. There were a lot of protesters. Almost two hundred billion. He took them all to my home planet, killed them with hydrogen bombs, and their souls... uh... how do I put this... he put them into the bodies of the creatures that are now called humans.;106;;
106;YEAH. THETANS. I want to know more!!;;;
;These free souls that inhabited those creatures' bodies are called thetans. The goal of every thetan is becoming an operating thetan.

This is not the essence of Scientology.;107;;
107;I DON'T LIKE MYSELF. Dad must not have loved me. I HAVE TO CHANGE. CHANGE.;;;
;You want to change? It's very easy! You just have to become an operating thetan! There are different kinds of them. Fifteen levels. The higher your level, the more of an operating thetan you are.

108;YEEEEEAAAH! *The Bork cries out.* I WANT TO! I WANT TO BECOME AN OPERATING THETAN! Me too!! Me too!! Glory!! Glory to L. Ron Hubbard!;;;
;The levels are reached very easily. Those who want to reach them have to hand me over all of their belongings and money. Well, not to me directly, but... actually, you could say it goes to me.;109;;
109;YES!! YES! YES!! BROTHER!! THROW OUT THE CARGO! TRANSFER THE MONEY! ALL HAIL THE GREAT RON! *The brothers cry out in unison.* Yes! Yes, O Great Ron!! Take our money and cargo!! Take our father's ship!! Make us operating thetans!!;;;
;This is how it is? Well… that's not much, of course… I think level three is enough for now.;110;;
110;YES!! Glory! Glory to L. Ron Hubbard!! I'M AN OVERAPING THETAN! OVERAPING THETAN!!!;;;
;Operating. Well, thanks for the money. I'll pick up your cargo. And now, go, tell the rest of your people about my Word. Your priority should be the rich, celebrities, acto- Ahem. You get it.;111;;
111;AS YOU SAY! AS YOU SAY, O GREAT ONE! Glory to you! O, glory to you!! *The Borks go off the line and jump, leaving the system. The really did transfer all their money and drop their cargo.*;;;
;Heh. I didn't think it would work. I must have chosen the wrong career.;112;;
112;*You suddenly hear Henry's voice.* You're a scary man, Captain. *There is so much sarcasm in his voice you could kill a kitten with it.*;marine_dialog;;
;Hey, think of the kittens. And in fact, I never even threatened them.;113;;
113;What do the kittens have to do with it, Captain? *Liszkiewicz is surprised.*;marine_dialog;;
;I don't really know, to be honest. Do you want me to tell you about Xenu?;114;;
114;*Suddenly, without even changing his expression, Henry stars laughing heartily. He barely manages to hit the button to go off the line, he's laughing so hard.*;marine_dialog;;
;You really shouldn't do that. Don't joke about Scientology!;-1;;6
