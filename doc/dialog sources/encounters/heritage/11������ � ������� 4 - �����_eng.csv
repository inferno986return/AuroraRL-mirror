0;You're back, Captain! *Lonroe looks at you extremely satisfied.* You've completed your assignment, yes?;;;;
;Not yet, I have no bodies.;1;;;
;First monster is done.;2;heritage.second_monster_killed;;
;My men shot the second monster. Did you know it burned some words in the walls of his lair with acid?;3;heritage.third_monster_killed;;
;The third one… It's going to be funny, but it killed itself.;4;heritage.fourth_monster_killed;;
;About the fourth creature…;6;heritage.fifth_monster_killed;;
1;Then come back when you have some! Don't waste my time and your own, Captain.;;;;
;Of course. Over and out.;-1;;;
2;Great, simply wonderful! Send the corpse over, and I'll transfer you the money.;;;;
;Pleasure to work with you.;-1;;;second_paid
3;But still, it attacked your people, Captain. That means it wasn't intelligent. Don't let your conscience eat you from the inside, my friend. You're doing a good thing. Send the corpse to me and I'll transfer you the money.;;;;
;Doing a good thing? I really hope I am. Over and out.;-1;;;third_paid
4;Really? Are you serious?;;;;
;And a long time before we came, too. It slit its own throat. And it was trying to write poetry.;5;;;fourth_paid
5;*Lonroe clicks a sad, somber rhythm.* Too bad. Maybe it really was intelligent. I hope we can find that out soon through studying its corpse. Here's your money.;;;;
;Of course. Over and out.;-1;;;
6;Yes?;;;;
;I brought it alive. It's intelligent.;7;;;
;My people couldn't find it.;9;;;
;I decided to keep it.;11;;;
7;What? Are you sure about that? *Lonroe leans forward, he's shocked.*;;;;
;Absolutely. I had a long conversation with it. There's definitely something wrong with its head, but I wouldn't call it stupid.;8;;;
8;So that's how it is... So, after all... Ahem. *Lonroe leans back and smiles.* This is just wonderful news, human captain. You deserve a bonus. You're one of the best investments ever made by the Vortangu Corp.;;;;
;Glad to hear that. Always a pleasure to work with people like you.;-1;;20;
9;*Lonroe frowns.*;;;;
;We searched the whole planet, combed it with scanners. Nothing. Looks like it managed to climb into some deep hole and die there.;10;;;
10;Let it rest in peace, then. *Lonroe is annoyed, he draws his speech slowly and petulantly.* I think you understand that I cannot pay for such a voyage. There is nothing to pay you for. There is nothing to discuss there. It was a pleasure to work with you, human captain. Not as good as I expected, but pleasant. *The connection breaks. Lonroe simply signed off.*;;;;
;So that's how it is. He really got mad.;-1;;10;
11;So what are you going to do with it, human captain? *Lonroe laughs.* Sic it on your enemies like a pet animal?;;;;
;Could be. But probably not. It's intelligent.;14;;;
;That's none of your business.;12;;;
12;You're right, it is. I guess it's no use telling you that you're holding corporate assets... Let it be like that, human captain. You aren't getting paid for your voyage, I think that much is obvious.;;;;
;I didn't expect anything different.;13;;;
13;*Lonroe nods. His voice is quiet and silky.* Looks like the rumors about you were greatly exaggerated, Captain… *He shakes his head and signs off.*;;;;
;They say a lot of things about me. Although… He can't hear me anyway.;-1;;30;
14;In that case, you must hand it over to us. It is our corporate asset. We can study it, help it... Human captain, you're making a mistake!;;;;
;You're right. You know what… take it, after all.;15;;;
;It wanted to stay. I can't force it to go.;16;;;
15;*Lonroe leans back and smiles.* It's a good thing you changed your mind. Trust me, we won't harm that creature. As for you... You deserve a bonus. You're one of the best investments ever made by the Vortangu Corp.;;;;
;Glad to hear that. Over and out, Lonroe.;-1;;20;
16;*Lonroe is annoyed. His skin is covered in big drops of slime.* Yes. You're right. *His answers sound like hissing.* This is unethical. Let it be like that. Keep that creature. You won't get any money for it, of course. And you don't look like you need it, anyway. *The connection drops. Looks like someone disconnected too quickly.*;;;;
;If he doesn't calm down, he'll explode all over his office. His office is cool. I'd like one like that... hm... Maybe I could ask Sarah to renovate my quarters…;-1;;30;
