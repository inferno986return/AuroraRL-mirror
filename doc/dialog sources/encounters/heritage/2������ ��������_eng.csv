0;*Wow, Gordon is calling.*;
;What is it?;1
1;C-c-captain. *Gordon nods hello.* We've studied the creature that our squad killed. It really is a Klisk, Captain.;
;A Klisk the size of a hippopotamus that spits acid? Wow.;2
2;Don't be sceptic! It can't be a mistake, I assisted Dr Stoltz during the vivisection personally!;scientist_dialog_scared
;How can it be a Klisk, then?;3
;Don't get mad, I'm just really surprised. What were you able to find out?;3
3;*Gordon is still a but offended, so he uses short snappy phrases.* Body structure almost identical to Klisks'. Same epithelium structure, slime discharge. Similar brain, similar anatomy. Similar antennae. Differences start after that.;
;Well?;4
4;First of all, symmetrical glands that produce the acid. The action mechanism looks a lot like the one that is used by the Brachius sp... *Gordon checks himself.* I mean, used by bombardier beetles, sorry. To put it simply, two glands secrete the acid components, the components mix, and the acid shoots out. There. I can also say that the creature was very strong. If our people had acted less efficiently, it could have killed them all.;
;Some Klisk it is. What do you say, Gordon? How did this monster get to that planet? Why does it look so much like a Klisk? ;5
5;*Gordon shrugs and wipes his glasses.* The only thing that is clear is that the creature definitely didn't come from that planet. It's one-of-a-kind, the scanner didn't find any more. We couldn't find out anything else. *After thinking for about ten seconds, Gordon finally says...* That'll be all, Captain.;scientist_dialog_puzzled
;That's not much. But you've done all you can. Over and out, Gordon.;6
6;Aye, aye, Captain. *Before signing off, he adds…* Maybe we should show the data we've procured to the Klisks? They'll probably be interested.;
;Maybe we should. I'll think about it, Gordon.;-1
