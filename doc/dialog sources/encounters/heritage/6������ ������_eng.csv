;Copy that, Captain speaking. Don't be surprised, this is an important mission, so you'll be talking to me directly.;1
1;Roger that, sir. Ahem… We shot another monster.;
;Congratulations, squad! You did it, that's great.;2
2;The body is ready to be transported to the Aurora 2. But... I don't know... maybe you'll find it interesting... This bastard lived in a cave, just like the one before it.

;You will write a detailed report, soldier. And prepare the atmospheric suit recordings. Over and out.;-1
