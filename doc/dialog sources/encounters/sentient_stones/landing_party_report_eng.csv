0;Aurora 2, come in! This is the landing party, come in!;;;;
;Aurora 2 listening, go ahead.;1;;;
1;Captain, sir… There is no life on this planet. Not on the surface, not below it. But the scanners have gone haywire! Captain, it seems that they react to stones that way…;;;;
;Stones?!;2;;;
2;Sir, yes, sir! We are registering some kind of alpha waves and biorhythms from some rocks. What do we do, Captain? Do we bring one of the rocks onboard?;;;;
;It's weird… I have to contact the Science Department. Wait… Gordon! Can you hear me?;3;;;
3;C-Captain? *Gordon looks a bit unkempt, the collar of his shirt is covered in… is that mustard?*;scientist_dialog;;;
;We have a small problem with this planet. And also you have some mustard on your collar.;4;;;
4;It's not mustard, it's agar. *Gordon snorts and waves it off.* What's the problem, sir?;scientist_dialog;;;
;Stones. The soldiers say the scanners register their brain waves and biorhythms. Looks like our ship scanner clocked them too.;5;;;
5;Uhhh… Sapient? Live rocks, C-Captain?;scientist_dialog;;;
;Looks like it… We need to make a choice: either we bring one of the rocks onboard for analysis or not.;6;;;
6;*Gordon opens his mouth to answer but cuts himself off.* They... hm... if they're alive, that's one thing. What if they're sentient? That's another thing entirely. A v-v-very complicated question, C-Captain. Do we dare taking a sentient being from its homeplanet without asking? *He rubs the bridge of his nose.* If it really is sentient, that is.;scientist_dialog;;;
;Alive or sentient… What does it matter? They're just rocks.;7;;;
;Discussing ethics? I thought your love for vivisection would be stronger.;9;;;
;So what do we do?;11;;;
;I think I know what to do.;14;;;
7;I understand, C-Captain, it's not easy to accept a rock as sentient, buuuut... *Gordon stutters and scratches the back of his head absentmindedly.* What if they're sentient and we take one of them? It'll be kidnapping a real personality, a peaceful hum- a creature! That's most... *He screws up his face.* Antiscientific!;scientist_dialog;;;
;Antiscientific? I remember Unit 731 from the academic history classes.;8;;;
8;*Gordon loses his confidence completely and mumbles something about new times, humanism, and compassion.;scientist_dialog;;;
;Discussing ethics? I thought your love for vivisection would be stronger.;9;;;
;So what do we do?;11;;;
;I think I know what to do.;14;;;
9;I'm a scientist, C-Captain. Not a barbarian.;scientist_dialog;;;
;That never stopped you from performing autopsies on some sentient creatures.;10;;;
10;Corpses. I can autopsy a dead Klisk, Bork, human for studying… Killing them for this? *Gordon shakes his head no.*;scientist_dialog;;;
;Alive or sentient… What does it matter? They're just rocks.;7;;;
;So what do we do?;11;;;
;I think I know what to do.;14;;;
11;It's that time, C-Captain, where I absolve myself of all responsibility and put it on you. I follow your orders. I'll agree to whatever you say.;scientist_dialog;;;
;That's not very fair Gordon.;12;;;
12;You're the boss. I'm not. *Gordon rubs his nose and lowers his eyes for a couple of seconds.*;scientist_dialog;;;
;Alive or sentient… What does it matter? They're just rocks.;7;;;
;Discussing ethics? I thought your love for vivisection would be stronger.;9;;;
;I think I know what to do.;14;;;
13;*After thinking it over for a bit, Gordon replies.* This is a good idea, C-Captain. Of course, there are risks... what if the stones turn out to be agressive? But... I think that's a good proposition. *He nods.*;scientist_dialog;;;
;Alive or sentient… What does it matter? They're just rocks.;7;;;
;Discussing ethics? I thought your love for vivisection would be stronger.;9;;;
;So what do we do?;11;;;
;I think I know what to do.;14;;;
14;In that case you don't need me, Captain? *Gordon walks away without even turning offhis camera. You can see right away how he chews someone out, waving his hands.*;scientist_dialog;;;
;Landing party, do you copy?;15;;;
15;Sir?;;;;
;Take one of the rocks onboard, we'll study it on the ship.;16;;;stone_taken
;Pack up and leave, don't take anything with you.;16;;;
16;Sir, yes, sir. Affirmative. *Click. Apparently, they've already started.*;;;;
