0;*Gordon doesn't look great. All the visible part of his coat is covered with dust and dirt. And there's a bruise glistening on his face. Apparently, head of the Sciene Department ran into something hard while skipping around the lab.* ...that's what happened.;;;
;And all this time you've been running from a stone in the lab?;1;;
1;*Gordon nods.* And then the s-soldiers came. Shot the rock a couple times, it calmed down. It looks alive. *He rubs his bruise.* I ordered to roll it into the cargo hold. It rolls around there from time to time.;;;
;It's a good thing there are no victims.;2;good;

;I've heard some of your people… weren't so lucky.;3;casualties;
;At least now we know the rock is a living being.;4;;
;So what do we do with it?;8;;
2;Yes. And that's miracle. Captain, my people don't want… that kind of exercise. They're intellectual workers, not physical laborers. *Gordon rubs his bruise again.* At least not always.;;;
;At least now we know the rock is a living being.;4;;
;So what do we do with it?;8;;
10;Yes. It's a good thing you outfitted the ship with a medbay back then. *Gordon rubs his bruise again.* Some of my colleagues had to be literally sewn together from pieces, but in the end, everyone is alive.;;;
;At least now we know the rock is a living being.;4;;
;So what do we do with it?;8;;
3;A horrible and stupid death… I… I never expected that. *Gordon rubs his bruise again.* Althought we all knew what we were signing up for when we came to the Aurora.;;;
;At least now we know the rock is a living being.;4;;
;So what do we do with it?;8;;
4;Alive, yes.;;;
;Is it sentient?;5;;
5;*Gordon shrugs.* Hard to say. The rock moved when we were studying it. It could have been a wild animal's reaction.;;;
;Maybe we should finish it off and perform an autopsy?;6;;
;Did you try talking to him or something?;7;;
;So what do we do with it?;8;;
6;The soldiers shot it almost clean through. And it's still alive and hitting the walls down there in the cargo hold. I don't think finishing it off will be so easy... at least without endangering the ship. And... can we? I don't approve of its reaction, but it could have just been defending itself. From its point of view we're barbarians and kidnappers. I'm sorry, but it's true, Captain.;;;
;Did you try talking to him or something?;7;;
;So what do we do with it?;8;;
7;First it wouldn't respond, then talking got pretty low on our list of priorities. *Gordon looks at the camera. He looks nervous, irritated, his eyes are red.*;;;
;Maybe we should finish it off and perform an autopsy?;6;;
;So what do we do with it?;8;;
8;I refuse to carry out any experiments on this creature as long as there exists a possibility of danger for me and my people. I'm sorry, Captain. I don't want it to happen again.;;;
;Maybe you could give me some advice.;9;;
9;If we can't either reach an agreement or calm that creature down, we better send that creature back to where we took it from. That's all I can say, Captain. You have the last word.;;;
;Right. Too much hassle. I've decided to throw that boulder into open space. *Open the external airlock in the cargo hold.*;-1;;1
;Okay, I'll think about it. Let it sit in our cargo hold for now. It can't hurt anyone in there.;-1;;
