;"""I'm glad you've worked something out. What is it?""";1
1;"""There is nothing left for us at the Aurora. We would like to stay some more, but... It's unfair. It's hypocritical. It's a waste of time. We realized what we should do, and... that's it.""";
;"""So what did you understand? I want to know.""";2
;"""Okay. We'll drop you off at your planet.""";3
2;"""Life is fleeting. Even for a creature like us. Very soon days would take seconds, months, dozens of seconds, years would last minutes... And we cannot afford wasting it on nothing. We have almost all of the time in the world, right? You don't, but you don't live in vain. We don't want to live in vain either.""";
;"""Okay. We'll drop you off at your planet.""";3
3;"""No. We… we want something else.""";
;"""What?""";4
4;"""We want to go into open space. We know we cannot pay you for the terminal and your hospitality, but... you got some scientific data from researching us, right? You will have to forgive the rest, we have nothing else to give, but... space, we want to go to space...""";
;"""Look, I know you won't die in there. But I still don't understand what for.""";5
5;"""We want to explore it. We want to see it. To go far every day and see something new. If we land on a planet, we'll crack and give life to many others. If not... We can simply live. Live with a purpose.""";
;"""Wouldn't it be better to go back to your planet, try to teach your kin something?""";6
6;"""What can I teach them? They're too used to what they are. And we are one. Only one.""";
;"""And… staying here? What's wrong with that?""";7
7;"""We won't lie, to live for a long time is interesting, human captain. But we'll outlive you. All of you. We'll even outlive the Aurora. And that would be very unpleasant... Please. Just drop me into open space. Anywhere. And that's it.""";
;"""I could refuse… But I won't. It's your choice. It would be very stupid to put my foot down because of my principles. We are all used to you and we respect your decision. I will let you know as soon as I'm ready.""";-1
