0;*A call from Science Department.*;
;Gordon? Uhm… you've really lost weight.;1
1;*And that's true. Gordon isn't even look thin now, he looks starving. He shrugs.* That's what happens when you work day after day, Captain. *His voice is still calm.* We don't have enough people. I have to work for five.;
;We all have it hard.;2
2;You do. You. But I don't. *Gordon takes out an injection gun and some capsule. He gives himself a shot in the neck and puts the gun back on the desk, out of the camera's view.* I really do feel better. I have my old stash.;
;What is that? Something for your nerves?;3
3;You could say that. It's good old morphine. The trick is knowing your exact dose, and then your head stays clear. And you don't feel any pain... and no cough... *Gordon gives you a crooked smile, and saliva mixed with blood drips from the corner of his mouth.*;
;The last thing I need is an addict as Head of Science Department, Gordon.;4
4;Oh, no, don't worry… *He wipes the blood with his hand.* I know when to employ extreme measures. Right now, I really do need this. Despite, I don't have much left. We... we're working... *He yawns.*;
;You should try to sleep.;5
5;*He smiles again.* I'll try. But later. If we don't do it on time… we'll have all the time in the world for sleeping, right? *It takes him a few tries, but finally, Gordon signs off with a shaky hand.*;
;Wow. I… didn't expect that.;-1
