;I'm listening, Gordon. You look a lot better.;1
1;*And he really does. Even though he's still pretty thin.* Yeah… I'm so glad it's over, Captain.;
;So true. I hope your people learned something from what happened.;2
2;*Gordon doesn't let you finish because his face goes from serene and happy to annoyed and... angry? Angry Gordon? That really doesn't happen a lot. He's hissing like a furious leopard.* If s-s-someone! S-s-somone el-l-lse! Approaches the samples without wearing an airtight science suit... with this hands! *Gordon shakes them.* I'll throw them out with these hands!;
;Easy, easy! This is the first time I've seen you like that… well, at least we all learned a lot. Over and out, Gordon. And double your rations, you look like a skeleton.;-1
