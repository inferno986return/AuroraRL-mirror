;Liszkiewicz, Goddamnit! Gordon! Gordon! Medics to Liszkiewicz's office, now!;1

2;*Henry props himself up on his elbows, reaches under his desk and takes out a bottle of something alcoholic. He pours himself a full glass. He gulps it down in one go, choking and grunting.* It helps a bit... It helps... *He coughs again.* I wanted to say th-that... if... if I don't... *Coughs.* It was an honor... an honor...;
;Shut up. Can you hear that? Someone's pounding on your door. It's the medics. Open up.;3
3;Yes, sir! *Henry presses the button that opens the door, then falls unconscious. You can see someone giving him a shot very quickly and putting him on the bed. Apparently, his unconscious state crossed over into sleep. The doctors say that Henry will wake up soon and he'll be feeling better.*;
;I hope this helps him.;-1
