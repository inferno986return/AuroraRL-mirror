0;Yeah… I can see something's wrong with you. *The Klisk clicks in a cute way. He's probably lying.*;;;
;I'll transfer all the data we have to you. We need medicine.;1;;
1;Well, then... *The Klisk reads the research data carefully. It takes a lot of time, he consults his science team several times.* Well, then! *The cute clicking again.* In some sense, you are lucky, human captain. You need to try really hard to get sick on a different planet. Turns out, you and the creatures you contracted it from aren't that different after all!;;;
;How ironic…;2;;
2;I hope you forgive me. And about the medicine… yes. We have it. And we can share the data that will help you adapt it for yourselves. 10 credits.;;;
;I'm not even going to haggle. There you go, sign here.;5;;
;I don't have that kind of money.;3;;
;How about a special proposition for a friend of the Klisks?;7;high_reputation;
3;I'm very sorry.;;;
;…;-1;;
5;Sign? What does that mean?;;;
;It's an expression. I accept your proposition and I'm ready to transfer the money.;6;;
6;Oh. Well, then… great, human captain. Always a pleasure doing business with you.;;;
;Likewise. Over and out.;-1;;1
7;That's true, human captain... *The Klisk clicks pensively and types something on his keyboard.* You really are a friend of our people. This isn't really following the Code to the letter, but... Heal your people. *Incoming data transfer request. It's the formula for the medicina you need.*;;;
;Thanks. You saved my crew.;8;;
8;Just don't think it'll work some other time, too. *Clicks of laughter.* Klisks value their friends, but money and friendly relations are incompatible, aren't they?;;;
;At least sometimes. Over and out.;-1;;2
