1;It looks like some kind of defense mechanism! Something like… white blood cells! They detect a threat to the organism in us and try to destroy us!;scientist_dialog

2;*Yes?*;scientist_dialog
;As I understand, trying to reason with them is pointless? ;3
;So we'll have to keep destroying them before they destroy us. ;4

;Right. And what about…;2
;Okay, let's take care of it. Over and out.;-1

;Right. And what about…;2
;Okay, let's take care of it. Over and out.;-1
