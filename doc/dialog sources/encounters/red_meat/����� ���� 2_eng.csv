0;Cap! That biomass of yours!! Viewport! My viewport!! *Sarah is having a real breakdown.* ;engineer_dialog_angry
;Frontz, are you out of your mind, screaming at the captain?;1
1;I'm sorry, Cap, but… *Sarah turns the camera towards the viewport... oh. It really does look disgusting. Who would have thought the biomass was so horrid up close? You can see what Sarah meant.* ;
;Calm down and turn the camera back around. I understand, it's disgusting to see something like that in your own quarters. But that's not a reason to have a breakdown in front of the captain.;2
2;*Sarah waves her hands.* I'm sorry, Captain. It's just… I just woke up, and that… uhh! *She shudders.*;engineer_dialog_angry
;Order someone to clean it off, and… I don't know, it'll grow back anyway. We're lucky it didn't spread all over the hull.;3
3;And what about my viewport?;
;You'll just have to shut it.;4
4;*Sarah, thinking that she's the only one who can hear it, roars quietly, but she seems to be calming down gradually.* All right. I'll shut the window. Captain, please do something about that thing. ;
;I'm already on it. Over and out.;-1
