0;*Dusk. Your men report that they are next to the old building... well, you see that yourself on the camera. It is a couple of stories tall, it's wide, massive and looks a lot like an Earth building. The windows are broken. The signal you're searching for comes from this building, and it looks like there is someone inside. Your men ask for further instructions.*;;;
;Don't enter the building. Standby, stay frosty.;1;;
1;*Nothing happens for the next few minutes. Then, armed Zorsan appear in the windows. Another one comes out, unarmed.* Don't shoot. *He throws his hands up. His idiotic cape makes him look especially fat.* I'm unarmed. Don't shoot, humans.;;;
;What does this all mean?;2;;
2;What, do you want us to discuss it right here? *The Zorsan smiles.* How about you... *He looks at your men, then narrows his eyes and corrects himself.* Us. We lower our weapons first, then you do it. *Your man reports that he has looked the Zorsan over completely, and gives you a dry description. Like all Zorsan, he isn't very tall, his clothes are baggy, there's some kind of cape. It looks battered, but it's not torn, it must be made from some kind of defensive material. His face is smooth, no scars. There are some trinkets that pass through his sleeve. Some kind of cheap metal.*;;;
;No one is entering the building.;3;;
3;No one is. And so that you're more comfortable... *The Zorsan whistles. His comrades leave the building one by one, the ones who were standing next to the windows. They're armed, but they don't look like they're going to shoot. Although, who knows?* Now we can see each other plainly.;;;
;So what do you wanted? We were at war, last I checked.;4;;
4;*He nods in response. The Zorsan's hands are still up.* We are. And believe it or not, a lot of people don't like it. I don't, for one. My friends, either. And there are more. Of those who don't like it. The war.;;;
;We got a message from you.;5;;
5;That's right. Message. Very profitable for you, foreigners. *He chuckles.* You can earn some money and end the war. And even make some friends... *The leader of the landing party quietly reports that he doesn't know what to say next.*;;;
;Ask him about the money.;6;;
;The war. That sounds like a tall order. Let him tell us more.;7;;
;Friends? Does he mean himself?;8;;
;Was he the one who sent the messenger?;9;;
;Less talk, more action. Let him tell us what he wants.;10;;
6;Yeah. Money. It's simple. There is a job that would be best suited for huuumans. *The Zorsan chuckles a little. He still hasn't brought his hands down. It looks as if he was making fun of you.* You've made it through the Special Ops, and even punched out Zheurde the Big Wig. If I managed to punch out Zheurde, I'd be sooo happy...;;;
;The war. That sounds like a tall order. Let him tell us more.;7;;
;Friends? Does he mean himself?;8;;
;Was he the one who sent the messenger?;9;;
;Less talk, more action. Let him tell us what he wants.;10;;
7;What is there to tell? I'm just... Something like Messenger #2. There's war. It's bad. No one needs it except the Emperor and his brown-nosers. Do you need it? *He asks one of his people, and the response is a no.* No! Well, I don't need it either.;;;
;Ask him about the money.;6;;
;Friends? Does he mean himself?;8;;
;Was he the one who sent the messenger?;9;;
;Less talk, more action. Let him tell us what he wants.;10;;
8;There's a lot of them. Everyone will be happy to work with you, human captain. And with captain's humans, too.;;;
;Ask him about the money.;6;;
;The war. That sounds like a tall order. Let him tell us more.;7;;
;Was he the one who sent the messenger?;9;;
;Less talk, more action. Let him tell us what he wants.;10;;
9;No. I wasn't the one who sent the messenger.;;;
;Ask him about the money.;6;;
;The war. That sounds like a tall order. Let him tell us more.;7;;
;Friends? Does he mean himself?;8;;
;Less talk, more action. Let him tell us what he wants.;10;;
10;I told you. You could work for someone who doesn't like the current situation on Zorsan.;;;
;Rebels?;11;;
11;Yes. You could call it that. It's your call, human captain. But with your help, it could all be solved pretty quickly. The war is bad. No one needs it. Make a decision.;;;
;It sounds a lot like a trap. I'd better say no.;12;;
;Sounds pretty good. I think we should agree. But be on your guard!;14;;
12;We really need your help, human captain. *The Zorsan isn't smiling anymore, his hands are trembling a little.* Refusing to give it looks suspicious.;;;
;Are they trying to threaten us? That won't help. We're leaving.;13;;
;Better not provoke him. And how bad could it be, anyway? We can always just walk away. Say yes.;14;;
13;No, what threats? Just… *Suddenly, he waves his hand. The Zorsan train their weapons on your men.*;;;
;Attack!;-1;;1
14;Great. In that case, let me lower my hands. *The Zorsan does that, and calls one of his people over. They have a conversation. First, they're whispering, then it becomes louder. The Zorsan speaks again, looking very embarrassed.* The situation has become more complicated... It's stupid... Very stupid...;;;
;What is it?;15;;
15;I'm just the messenger, I'm delivering a message. But, alas...*The Zorsan shrugs.* Let's just say, it's not there anymore. You'll have to look for the roaming station in a different way. Outer systems, human captain, that are marked red, the ones already touched upon by the Obliterator. You'll have to look for the station there.;;;
;A roaming station, then?;17;;
;And there aren't any details?;16;;
16;Look for it in red giant systems in Zorsan space and around it. I can't tell you anything else. It's stupid, but we just lost the coordinates.;;;
;In that case… Ah, damn it. I don't understand anything. Get back to the ship.;-1;;
17;Roaming station… Yeah, it's serious. We're not playing games here, human captain.;;;
;And there aren't any details? How do I find it?;16;;
