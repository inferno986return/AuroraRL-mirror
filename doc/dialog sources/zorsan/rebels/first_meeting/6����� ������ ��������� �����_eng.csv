0;*Henry calls you. His clothes are pressed, and he is well-groomed as always.* Captain. Do you have a minute?;;
;What did you want?;1;
1;We were scanning the station while you were there. Their defenses aren't the best, so I managed to eavesdrop on some parts of your conversation. Sorry.;;
;That's not what an officer is supposed to do, Henry. We were having a private conversation.;2;
;I understand. It's better to be safe than sorry..;3;
2;Sorry. I won't appeal a fine or even time in the brig. However, let me ask something.;;
;I'm listening.;4;
3;I'm glad you understand. And I hope you'll answer a question I'm going to ask you.;;
;I'm listening.;4;
4;Did you say yes or no?;;
;Yes. We're going to work for these rebels.;7;rebels_continue
;No. It's not worth the trouble.;5;rebels_reject
5;Oh. I thought you'd say yes. Their proposition really does look lucrative, Captain.;;
;Doesn't matter. Blood isn't cheap. We aren't Wild Geese. And I'm not Bob Denard. The mission of our ship is completely different.;6;
6;*Henry smiles. It's the first time you see him do it, and it's very bright. It's kind.* I'm proud to serve under you, Captain. *He's silent for a bit, then he adds.* I really am. *He salutes you and signs off.*;;
;Hm…;-1;
7;Do you think you did the right thing?;;
;I don't know. But his offer was lucrative, wasn't it? It's hard to say no.;8;
8;That's true. It's hard to say no. And war, it's just controlled violence. *Henry looks at you weirdly, but since you're having a video conversation, it's hard to say what exactly he's feeling.* Don't forget, Captain, you're the boss. Be responsible. *He salutes you and signs off.*;;
;I'll try. Yeah. I'll try.;-1;
