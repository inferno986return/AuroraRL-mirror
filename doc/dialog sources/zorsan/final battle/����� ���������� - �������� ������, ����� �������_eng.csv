1;*Henry is reclining in his chair and sipping something from a glass. It looks like alcohol.* Oh, Captain… Hello.;marine_dialog;;;
;Yeah, Liszkiewicz. I can see you're relaxing.;2;;;
;Report on the status of the weapon systems and the crew.;6;;;
;There's going to be a battle… I don't know what to think.;8;;;
;Nevermind. I was checking the comms. Over and out.;99;;;
2;What else can I do? Maybe I… ahem… I don't want to sound subversive. I just decided to have a little drink. Is that a bad thing, Captain?;marine_dialog;;;
;No. I'd have one myself, to be honest.;3;;;
;"""Little"" is the operating word here, right?";4;;;
;You need a clear head and complete control in battle.;5;;;
3;*Henry smiles.* Good brandy is included in the Captain's ration. The important thing is not to overdo it. *He finishes his drink and puts the glass on the table.*;marine_dialog;;;
;I'll keep that in mind. Report on the status of the weapon systems and the crew.;6;;;
;There's going to be a battle… I don't know what to think.;8;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;;;
4;I can see we have some things in common. *He finishes his drink and puts his glass on the table.**;marine_dialog;;;
;Report on the status of the weapon systems and the crew.;6;;;
;There's going to be a battle… I don't know what to think.;8;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;;;
5;*Henry finishes his drink and puts his glass on the table.* This is it, don't worry. Is there anything else?;marine_dialog;;;
;Report on the status of the weapon systems and the crew.;6;;;
;There's going to be a battle… I don't know what to think.;8;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;;;
6;The crew is doing good, they're nervous but ready for action. The weapon systems are okay, we're giving them maximum power.;marine_dialog;;;
;Can the Aurora 2 handle a long fight?;7;;;
7;I wouldn't know, you better ask Frontz, Captain… But I think it can. But we better not jump into the thick of it.;marine_dialog;;;
;I can see you're relaxing.;2;;;
;There's going to be a battle… I don't know what to think.;8;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;;;
8;Don't think about it.;marine_dialog;;;
;How can I not think about it? There's so much responsibility.;9;;;
9;Well, relax then, Captain. War… *Henry smiles, but he doesn't look very happy.* The thing about it is, you get used to it. And you'll get used to it, too. If we make it.;marine_dialog;;;
;Did it take you long to get used to it?;10;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;;;
10;I'm a different case. You could say that war is my real mother. I didn't have to get used to it. Doesn't matter. In any case, don't worry. We're cogs in a machine. Everything that's supposed to spin is spinning, and everything that's supposed to run is running. This is the best thing we can expect.;marine_dialog;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;;;
11;*Sarah is reading a book. You can't see the cover. When she gets the call, she looks at the camera and smiles.* Yo, Cap.;engineer_dialog;;;
;What are you reading?;12;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;17;;;
;There's going to be a battle. What do you think?;20;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;crew.engineer<5;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;98;crew.engineer>4;;
12;Oh, it's… *She waves her hand dismissively, closes the book and puts it aside.* It's religious, one of my dad's books. I don't think you'll get it.;engineer_dialog;;;
;You're trying to find solace in your faith?;13;;;
13;No… *She blushes and shakes her head.* Yes! Even if it's true, you say it like it's a bad thing.;engineer_dialog;;;
;There is no place for God on a space ship. Even if He exists, He stayed in the skies. We're above Him.;14;;;
;There's nothing wrong about that. I just asked you a question.;15;;;
;No, of course not. If that's what your sould needs, why not? I approve your choice.;16;;;
14;It's just your opinion. It's blunt, but true.;engineer_dialog;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;17;;;
;There's going to be a battle. What do you think?;19;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;crew.engineer<5;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;98;crew.engineer>4;;
15;And I just gave you an answer. *She shrugs and smiles.*;engineer_dialog;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;17;;;
;There's going to be a battle. What do you think?;19;;;
16;You're talking like some… ew. Okay. I didn't want to offend you, just… *She blushes again.*;engineer_dialog;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;17;;;
;There's going to be a battle. What do you think?;19;;;
17;If it was possible to get the most out of the equipment without harming it or losing firepower, I did it. I give you my word: *she really stresses that last part* our girl won't let you down.;engineer_dialog;;;
;Great. Good job.;18;;;
18;*She blushes and looks to the side, then adds.* But we shouldn't throw ourselves into the thick of it. We're not the Voyager.;engineer_dialog;;;
;How do you know about the Voyager?;19;;;
;There's going to be a battle. What do you think?;20;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;crew.engineer<5;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;98;crew.engineer>4;;
19;I found about it on Earth. Or rather, from Earth. It's a big project, everyone keeps talking about it. *Sarah says all of it without pausing for breath or looking away.*;engineer_dialog;;;
;There's going to be a battle. What do you think?;20;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;crew.engineer<5;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;98;crew.engineer>4;;
20;What can I say? I'm afraid. Are you afraid?;engineer_dialog;;;
;Yes.;21;;;
;I don't know.;21;;;
;No.;21;;;
21;It's a stupid question, but… Captain… I wanted to ask you something. It's very personal.;engineer_dialog;;;
;Of course.;23;;;
;If it's so personal, maybe you shouldn't.;22;;;
22;Oh… Okay then.;engineer_dialog;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;crew.engineer<5;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;98;crew.engineer>4;;
23;Do you believe in God?;engineer_dialog;;;
;Um… That's a strange question. No, I'm an atheist.;24;;;
;Hard to say.;26;;;
;Yeah, I do.;27;;;
24;*Sarah looks at you with a slight, a little pitying smile.* How is it, Cap? You live for the first and only time, and then, boom! You're going into the black nothing.;engineer_dialog;;;
;You're talking as if death was the only thing Man had. But he also has life. And that's the most thing. It's what makes us human.;25;;;
25;*Sarah's smile becomes crooked.* There is some sense in what you're saying. I've never thought about it like that. Although… that's just your opinion.;engineer_dialog;;;
;What are you reading?;12;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;17;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;crew.engineer<5;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;98;crew.engineer>4;;
26;Why not? You're not confident in yourself? *Sarah's smile looks patronizing.*;engineer_dialog;;;
;Yeah. And if I believed in Him, I'd doubt myself even more. I think faith isn't as much a sign of your being chosen as a much bigger responsibility. In a way, I have it easier than you.;25;;;
27;Oh… Captain… I wonder. When you need to make a choice, any choice… How do you do it? Do you make it according to your religious beliefs or something else?;engineer_dialog;;;
;I do what my mind tells me. Not because I'm disrespectful, no. It's just the world we live in.;28;;;
;That's a hard question. I don't know how to answer it. It all depends on the situation.;29;;;
;I do it based on my religious beliefs. It's good when you have something to believe in.;30;;;
28;*It looks like Sarah's become a bit sad.* Yeah… That's the world we live in. Is there anything else, Cap?;engineer_dialog;;;
;What are you reading?;12;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;17;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;98;;;
29;Your position is a bit too cautious, Captain. I mean, it's good, being in the middle is the best thing, but I think sometimes you need to have an opinion of your own.;engineer_dialog;;;
;What are you reading?;12;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;17;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;crew.engineer<5;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;98;crew.engineer>4;;
30;I could agree with you, but… *She winces.* Doesn't matter. Is there anything else?;engineer_dialog;;;
;What are you reading?;12;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;17;;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;99;crew.engineer<5;;
;All right, that's all for now. Over and out.;98;crew.engineer>4;;
98;Oh, Cap, wait! *She smiles slyly.* It's been a long time… you promised me a dinner. Captain's ration. *She licks her upper lip playfully, her eyes shine.* I think it's the perfect time to remind you.;engineer_dialog;;;
;Oh, damn it. I've forgotten about it. I think the calm before the storm isn't the best time for that. We'll see afterwards.;101;;;
101;I won't let you forget this!;engineer_dialog;;;
;Woe is me…;99;;;
31;*You're surprised to see that Gordon is reading some book by candlelight.* What… ah! Captain!! *He adjusts his glasses.* Sorry. That was sudden. I didn't expect that.;scientist_dialog;;;
;What happened here? What is… all that?;32;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;38;;;
;There's going to be a battle. Are you nervous?;39;;;
;Nevermind. I was checking the comms. Over and out.;99;;;
32;Oh… this… *He smiles.* Nothing. I like reading by candlelight.;scientist_dialog;;;
;Why?;33;;;
33;*The candlelight is reflected in Gordon's glasses. He looks inspired.* It gives you a sense of... of something unusual. Something new... *He speaks excitedly.* Captain, maybe we shouldn't even go to war with the Zorsan?;scientist_dialog;;;
;What do you mean, we shouldn't? They're attacking, we're defending. There's no choice.;34;;;
34;Yeah… but… *He waves his hands around.* They're different! And we're different! Peace is better! They're completely new... Maybe we and they, we could have... Could have repeated…;scientist_dialog;;;
;Are you talking about your experiment? The third phase? If it was stopped, there was a reason.;35;;;
;Gordon, it's no time for thoughts like those. I'm not accusing you of anything, but you're setting an example. What do your people see now?;36;;;
;I understand your opinion and I respect it, but… There's nothing we can do. Maybe when all this is over we'll work together with the Zorsan.;37;;;
35;There was… *You can see incredible sadness in Gordon's eyes.* Captain… Oh, you won't understand. I don't want to talk about this.;scientist_dialog;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;38;;;
;There's going to be a battle. Are you nervous?;39;;;
;All right, that's all for now. I was checking the comms. Over and out.;99;;;
36;Yeah… *Gordon cleans his glasses nervously with his sleeve.* Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. But still… No. No. Thank you, Captain. Is there anything else?;scientist_dialog;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;38;;;
;There's going to be a battle. Are you nervous?;39;;;
;All right, that's all for now. I was checking the comms. Over and out.;99;;;
37;We will… Phase three... *Gordon is looking away from the camera. He looks musing. Because of the weak light from the candles, it looks like his eyes are behind some kind of fog. Suddenly, he speaks.* Okay... Is there anything else, Captain?;scientist_dialog;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;38;;;
;There's going to be a battle. Are you nervous?;39;;;
;All right, that's all for now. I was checking the comms. Over and out.;99;;;
38;It's all right. Science department is in power-saving mode. Everything for the war effort, right?;scientist_dialog;;;
;What happened here? What is… all that?;32;;;
;There's going to be a battle. Are you nervous?;39;;;
;All right, that's all for now. I was checking the comms. Over and out.;99;;;
39;Not really. *He shakes his head and speaks surprisingly calmly, with a voice that is completely different from his usual one.* The Science department is well-shielded from a stray hit. And if something does manage to get to us... *He shrugs.* We'll all get some.;scientist_dialog;;;
;You're saying all this as if it didn't worry you at all.;40;;;
40;What do you mean? What… *He stutters and blushes.* What am I supposed to be worried about?;scientist_dialog;;;
;Well, death, for one. I think that's a good reason.;41;;;
41;Death? Oh… That's right. *Gordon looks calm and stays silent, waiting for your orders.*;scientist_dialog;;;
;What happened here? What is… all that?;32;;;
;Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.;38;;;
;All right, that's all for now. I was checking the comms. Over and out.;99;;;
42;*A low hum fills the air instantly. Your entire ship can hear you, from the navigator's quarters to the machine deck. You need to say something. You can't just disconnect now.*;;;;
;Crew. This is your captain speaking. We are faced with a difficult test. Anyway. I would like to address you.;43;;;
;Hello to all of you. I would like to say a few words.;44;;;
;This is the captain speaking… Something very difficult awaits us. I won't have another moment to talk to you. And I can't keep silent anymore. I just can't.;45;;;
43;*You can hear your own voice from the other side of your quarters door, faintly. Despite this, it sounds… spirited.*;;;;
;It's hard to say what expects us. It really is. War is kind to no one. Not even us, despite the fact that we're its children. But we don't have a choice. The Universe is huge, but there's no place we can retreat to: the Earth is behind us!;46;;;
44;*You can hear your own voice from the other side of your quarters door, faintly. Maybe that's why it sounds so neutral.*;;;;
;I chose this moment and this place to talk about the thing that brought us all here. We're going to war. And I'm about to say what for.;46;;;
45;*You can hear your own voice from the other side of your quarters door, faintly. It sounds quiet yet firm.*;;;;
;I don't want to talk about war. I don't want to talk about the battle. I want to talk about… You know… I'll tell you something. I have a dream.;46;;;
46;*You wonder how your crew reacted to that. Doesn't matter. Go on.*;;;;
;The conditions are new to us, and we aren't used to such battles. But don't be afraid. It's just a good old war. And war never changes.;47;;;
;It's very simple. We're fighting for our world. No, not the Pax Humana, but our world. Our world as our future, as the future of our children.;48;;;
;I dream about many things. And I don't dream about anything in particular. I dream about the entire Universe. A Universe populated by various creatures. Creatures that can call each other their equals.;49;;;
47;"*If you wanted to boost your people's morale, you've done it. It's time to wrap it up. Everything is good in moderation.""";;;;
;And because of that, I'm confident. I'm confident of you and of myself. Of everyone who is on our side of the barricades today. We will win. And I order you to share my confidence.;50;;;
48;*Is it right, to talk about future with those who may not have it? It doesn't matter. Time to wrap it up. Everything is good in moderation.*;;;;
;And I still haven't said the most important thing: we'll be fighting for their future, too. Those who will come at us with weapons drawn today. Someone said that it wasn't hate that hurt, it was indifference. In a sense, it's true.;50;;;
49;*Was it a good idea to talk about peace when facing mortal danger? We'll see. Now, it's time to wrap it up. Everything is good in moderation.*;;;;
;Today, I have that dream. It will always be with me, no matter what happens. It is a dream about a moment where all of us - the humans, the Klisks, the Borks, and even the Zorsan - where we all live together, and even if we don't love each other, at least we respect each other. I think that'll be the best outcome.;50;;;
50;*You finish your speech and turn off the PA system. Are you content with what you just said? And much more importantly, are they?*;;;;
;…;99;;;
