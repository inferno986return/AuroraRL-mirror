0;Captain, another wave of attackers has reached our system.;
;They still won't give it a rest?;1
;Are you ready for another drop?;1
1;There are no dropships among them this time. But there is a very large ship of an unknown type.;
;They must have decided to bring their Big Boss along. Any ideas about what it is?;2
2;It would be logical to assume that it's either a really big dropship or their own Death Star. In any case, we better not let it get to Earth.;
;Roger, we'll try to do that.;-1
