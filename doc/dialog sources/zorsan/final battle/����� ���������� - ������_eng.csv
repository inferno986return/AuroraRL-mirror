0;*Martan is looking at you. His face is glistening and his hair is greasy. There's a spot of some sauce on his collar. In general, his expression is a bit crazy.*;;
;You're not okay.;1;
1;I'm not okay. *He stops to wait for your reaction.*;;
;What happened?;2;
2;I haven't slept for five days. Six. Yeah, six. I haven't slept. We're running out of time. They're coming soon…;;
;Are you afraid?;3;
;Was there that much work?;10;
;I can see you haven't exactly taken care of yourself.;17;
;Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?;21;
3;I'm afraid.;;
;What are you afraid of?;4;
4;*His expression doesn't change.* Can't be assed to explain. I don't want to explain.;;
;We've known each other for years. Tell me.;5;
;Was there that much work?;10;
;I can see you haven't exactly taken care of yourself.;17;
;Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?;21;
5;*He still has the expression of an incredibly tired man.* I have a wife and child. We're getting attacked. I'm afraid. *He stops again. But then he starts talking. His cheek twitches.* It all depends on me. And I'm tired. And I don't know if you'll win.;;
;Martan Kilmovee has gone soft. Well, I think I'll go grab a skird and ballet shoes. You want them pink?;6;
;You said it yourself, it all depends on you. You need to stay focused.;7;
;Calm down. I understand you. I'm very scared, too.;8;
6;*Still completely calm, Martan picks up something fragile from the desk (looks like a voice recorder) and throws it at the wall. The thing breaks. Next time, he'll throw it at you. He exhales.* Yeah... you know... I feel a bit better now.;;
;There. Now you look more like yourself to me.;9;
7;Need. Everyone needs me to do something. My bosses need something. My employees need something. You need something. My wife needs something. My son needs something. Everyone needs something from me. And it's all on me... aaaah! *He hits the table with his fist and screams.* Yeah... in any case, thanks. I feel better now.;;
;It'll all be over soon.;9;
8;Will you look at that. He's scared. Don't lie. You've always been strange. I can't see any emotion at all in your face. It's like you're not you, like you're someone's doll, a puppet. What the hell do you even know?! *He punches the wall and moans in pain.* Right... Right, sorry. I just flew off the handle. But yeah, thanks. I feel better now.;;
;You're a bit unhinged, Martan, that's all. Calm down.;9;
9;Yeah… Yeah… I need to calm down.;;
;Was there that much work?;10;
;I can see you haven't exactly taken care of yourself.;17;
;Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?;21;
10;*Martan's face becomes a bit brighter. He looks a bit more sane now.* We armed everything we could. We had old ship projects that never went beyond one or two prototypes... Well, that'll be the support for you and the Voyager.;;
;By the way, what's up with that Voyager?;11;rogues.war_help && klisk.war_help
;By the way, what's up with that Voyager?;12;!rogues.war_help && klisk.war_help
;By the way, what's up with that Voyager?;12;rogues.war_help && !klisk.war_help
;By the way, what's up with that Voyager?;13;!rogues.war_help && !klisk.war_help
11;What about it? It's great. With our latest tech and what the aliens have provided... It's a scary weapon. You just have to remember that we only have one.;;
;So, what do we have?;14;
12;The Voyager is our best weapon. Too bad that not all aliens have helped us. But even so, the Voyager turned out… impressive.;;
;So, what do we have?;14;
13;You didn't manage to get the aliens to help us, and that's bad. But the Voyager is the apex of our technological genius. I think it'll contribute to the fight greatly.;;
;So, what do we have?;14;
14;We have your Aurora 2. Not the worst ship, but it's a research vessel, not a combat one. We have Flagship Voyager, you know it. ICS-34... honestly, it's more like our last line of defense, along with the AA guns. And there are short-flight space ships, they aren't a great help, but it's better than nothing.;;
;So it's not that bad, is it?;15;
;Is it bad?;16;
15;That's right. *Martan grabs his head and looks a bit like a sleep-walker again.*;;
;Are you afraid?;3;
;I can see you haven't exactly taken care of yourself.;17;
;Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?;21;
16;No. But you can't say our situation is great, either. *Martan grabs his head and looks a bit like a sleep-walker again.*;;
;Are you afraid?;3;
;I can see you haven't exactly taken care of yourself.;17;
;Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?;21;
17;What can I do? *He shrugs.* All of the responsibility is mine. There's a lot of work. I sleep right here. On the sofa in the break room.;;
;Oh… And what does Ntanda think about that?;18;
18;I sent her and our son to a guarded complex. It's safer there.;;
;Right, but do you call them, talk to them?;19;
19;*Martan looks at you with a truly unique expression.* I have no time for that.;;
;I don't get it… But that's expected. I'm not a family man.;20;
20;Damn right.;;
;Are you afraid?;3;
;Was there that much work?;10;
;Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?;21;
21;The main thing is, don't leave the system. We have no idea what to expect. So you just have to stay on your guard and be alert.;;
;That's pretty vague.;22;
22;I can't give you any other instructions now. You'll get them as they come.;;
;What about the Voyager? Which one of us is the boss?;23;
;In that case, I'll be off.;-1;
23;No one is. I doubt that trying to fight a war in space by Earth rules will lead to anything good.;;
;In that case, I'll be off.;-1;
