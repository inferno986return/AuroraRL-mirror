;Thanks for the help. Did anything happen?;1
1;Nothing serious. We got hit a couple times. The breaches are already fixed.;
;Need any help?;2
2;*Foorko shakes his head no.*;
;How did you know I needed your help?;3
;How many enemies did you kill?;4
;Where to now?;6
;Right. I can see you're okay. I have a new mission, I have to go. Over and out.;-1
3;Elder Hoor told me about it. He said it'd be nice to thank the human captain who had helped me… *Foorko smiles.**;
;How many enemies did you kill?;4
;Where to now?;6
;Right. I can see you're okay. I have a new mission, I have to go. Over and out.;-1
4;Not too many. You and your super flagship got most of it. It's a dangerous thing, that flagship... *Foorko frowns pensively.* You do know I'll have to report about it to the Elder?;

;How many enemies did you kill?;4

6;To my home system, the mothership. And then… I'm still getting ready to become an Elder, human captain. There are always things for me to do.;
;How did you know I needed your help?;3
;How many enemies did you kill?;4
;Where to now?;6
;In that case, I wish you luck. And I have to go, so I'm flying off. Over and out.;-1
