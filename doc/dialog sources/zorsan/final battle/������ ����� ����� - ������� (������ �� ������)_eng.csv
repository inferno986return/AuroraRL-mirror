0;Oh. You. What do you want?! *Hrrraka looks at you tiredly, but contentedly. In his eyes, you can see slight sadness, spleen, and the last remnants of his battle excitement going away... What is this nonsense? He's just baring his teeth. There's a lot you can see in the teeth of a Bork.*;;
;Thanks for the help. I didn't expect it from you.;1;
1;Oh. Yeah. *He waves his paw dismissively, jerks his head, and clicks his teeth nonchalantly.*;;

3;Kartar Hrrraka. *Hrrraka shakes his head angrily.* Punched me and said I was dumb!!! Arrrr! And then he sent me here, said that if I wanted to be like my brothers, I had to help you and not be a pirate. I helped. I'll go see my dad and punch him now!;;
;Oh. You have a really sweet relationship.;5;
4;Yeah. *Hrrraka shakes his head angrily.* Punched me and said I was dumb!!! Arrrr! And then he sent me here, said that if I wanted to be like my brothers, I had to help you and not be a pirate. I helped. I'll go see my dad and punch him now! ;;

;Where will you go now?;14;
;Right. I can see you're safe and sound. I have to go.;-1;
6;*Hrrraka looks around. Then he looks at the camera angrily. Then he looks around again.* What?!;;
;I said, is your ship okay? Are you okay?;7;
;Oh, nevermind, it doesn't matter.;5;
7;Oh. Yeah. *He thinks for a bit, then adds.* Nah. Navigator's dead.;;

;Are you all right? The battle was pretty fierce, you know.;6;
;How many did you kill?;9;
;Where will you go now?;14;
;Right. I can see you're safe and sound. I have to go.;-1;

;Are you all right? The battle was pretty fierce, you know.;6;
;How many did you kill?;9;
;Where will you go now?;14;
;Right. I can see you're safe and sound. I have to go.;-1;
10;*Hrrraka moves what passes for his lips pensively, narrows his eyes, and delves deeper into intellectual work.*;;
;*wait patiently some more*;11;
;How did you know I needed help?;2;
;Are you all right? The battle was pretty fierce, you know.;6;
;How many did you kill?;9;
