0;*The captain of the Voyager greets you with a smile. He has blond hair, slightly longer than what is the norm in the military world.* Aurora 2? Wow. I didn't expect you to contact us..;
;Well, we did. Good evening.;1
1;I don't think you've heard about me. I'm Jasper Byrne. You'll be surprised, but I'm also the captain of the Voyager. But I do know who you are. You could say you're a legend.;
;Glat to meet you. I'm very flattered, but I don't think it's the best time to be trading compliments.;2
2;*Jasper smiles.* That's right. No time for chit-chat. And speaking about the battle… Stay away from the Voyager. With all due respect, you'll just get in our way. We have different orders.;
;Yeah, I know. I'll keep that in mind. Over and out.;-1
