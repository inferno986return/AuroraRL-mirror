0;*Some bot hails you. It looks very similar to the one that was selling stuff on Earth's orbit.* You are greeted by a Hakazar combat drone. Hakazar: Be Ahead!;
;What the hell are you doing here?;1
1;*Suddenly, the drone turns on a voice recording. It is the voice of a typical middle-aged Klisk.* Human captain, this a representative of the Hakazar Company, Department of Inter-Species Client Relations. We know about the inconvenience we gave you. Because of that, and of the problems you are currently having, we temporarily give you full control of a squadron of battle drones to be utilized in an obvious way. Sincerely, the Hakazar Company. Hakazar: Be Ahead.;
;Wow, damn. Well… uh… how do I control you?;2
2;*The drone's own synthesized lifeless voice sounds again.* A list of objectives has already been uploaded to the memory. The targets are ships marked as Zorsan vessels. Executing orders. *It signs off.*;
;I hope it'll help us.;-1
