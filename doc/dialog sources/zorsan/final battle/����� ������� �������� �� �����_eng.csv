0;Captain, this thing just turned Washington D.C. into a giant hole in the ground! It's some insanely powerful platenary bomber!;
;What are the losses?;1
1;Less than it could have been, we evacuated most of the major cities' populations. But they're still very significant. It seems like the Zorsan have abandoned the idea of capturing us, and now they've decided to just destroy us. Captain, if this thing keeps firing, it'll destroy all of the main civilization centers in about ten shots and bring us nuclear winter. Destroy it ASAP!;
;We're on our way.;-1
