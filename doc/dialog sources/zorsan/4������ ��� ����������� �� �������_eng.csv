0;*Henry meets you right as you get out of the shuttle.* Captain, what happened on Zorsan?;
;Something really bad. Energy to weapon and defensive systems, full battle alert. Let's get out of here ASAP.;1
1;Affirmative. *Henry quickly passes the order over via his tablet.* Calm down. What happened?;
;Long story short, they tried to… probably capture us. I don't know what they were trying to achieve, we didn't wait for the story to unfold and attacked them right away.;2
2;Hm. And what started it all?;
;Their representative was very arrogant from the start. He passed the information package over somewhere, and then someone called him. Probably the ones he sent it to. That probably was what started it all, he was instructed as to what to do with us.;3
3;That's all suspicous. We should find out more with the… what was it? Klisks? Or is it the other ones who trade information?;
;It's them, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that we just got out to deep space, but we're already mixed up in a war. The ironic thing is, it's with a species that looks like us.;4
4;That really is ironic.;
;That's what I'm talking about. Right. Time to get back to our duties.;-1
