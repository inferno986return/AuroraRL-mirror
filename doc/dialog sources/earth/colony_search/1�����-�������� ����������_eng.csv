1;We have prepared them according to the information you had gethered about the planet. So you're the one who has to answer this question: did you study it well enough?;;
;What will I have to do?;3;
2;We have read your reports about the aggressive fauna and equipped the colonists with additional weaponry and means of defense. It's a good thing you studied it so well, otherwise they would have had a rough time.;;

3;We'll get the colonists and their equipment aboard your ship now. Your mission is to get them to the destination and have them disembark. After that, it's up to you. Of course, helping them set up would be a good idea, they'll need the extra workers. Any questions? ;;
;Who will handle supplying them in the future? Me? ;4;

;Damn, and I was just thinking that the reactor could use some cleaning. ;-1;
