0;Captain, the landing party has collected enough data about this planet. It has a breathable atmosphere, acceptable gravitation, and suitable climate. It's completely colonizable. But it would be nice if someone brought back some samples of the local fauna and resources.;
;Yeah, it would. Let them bring back a couple of local animals and look for some deposits.;-1
;No, I think it's enough. Let the colonists handle the rest, they'll have more time and resources for that.;-1
