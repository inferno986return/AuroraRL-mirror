;That's right. Well, are you ready for hardships?;1;colony_search.explored_fully
;Of course. Bring me back a souvenir.;3;!colony_search.explored_fully
1;Sure we are. That little pet you brought back with you... *He lets out a laugh and his gut trembles under his suit.* If the entire fauna is like that, it definitely won't be easy. It's a good thing we're armed to the teeth. Do you think all that - the planet, the resources - is worth it?;;

;Is it worth fighting for? Yes. Is it worth dying for? We'll see about that. ;2;
;Nothing is worth dying for.;7;
2;*The smile leaves his pudgy face.* I don't understand. ;;
;You don't have to. It's time for take-off.;-1;

;Beginning of what?;6;
6;*He can't hear you anymore. The shuttle door closes.* ;;
;*Leave the airlock.*;-1;
7;I don't think you're right, Captain. Sometimes it's necessary. ;;
;What can I do? This is how I am.;9;
9;*The colonist leader shakes his head and gets into the shuttle. The door closes. Time to leave the airlock.* ;;
