2;"*When you get to the observation room, you can see what scared Gordon so much. And there's a lot to be scared of.  A giant ship the size of an actual planet. It looks like a giant, weirdly elongated egg that... the easiest way to put it is ""it is in space."" It just is. As if it has always been there, next to the Sun. It is made from smooth gray metal that doesn't seem to have any seams. When you look back, you see almost the entire crew of the Aurora crowded behind you. In front of everyone are Gordon, Sarah, and Henry. The first one is frightened. The second one is so pale she looks white as chalk. The last one, keeping his head cool, asks you.* Captain. Do you know what it is?";;
;I think… I think I have an idea.;3;

;This is the Obliterator.;-1;
