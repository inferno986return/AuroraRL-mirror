0;*Gordon is looking at you from the screen again. If he looked crushed before, now you can't even begin to describe him. He looks like a man who clearly realizes he is going to die and has made peace with that.* That's it... we can't... ;
;What is it?!! Why aren't we jumping?! ;1
1;*no answer*;
;Gordon!;2
2;*He still won't respond. He's whispering something silently.* ;
;Officer! I order you to report!;3
3;*Shouting and being harsh worked. Gordon still hasn't quite snapped out of it, but at least he is talking now.* Gravitational perturbations... The star is expanding, do you understand? *He speaks quietly and calmly, not even stuttering as he usually does.* And so are the borders of the system. We just can't reach them. We can't jump from here, either... ;
;So what do we do?! Sarah, can we accelerate some more? ;4
4;No can do, boss. We're doing everything we can. The engines are at 110% capacity, we're using up all reserves. We can't make them go any faster! ;engineer_dialog
;Gordon, do you have any ideas?;5
5;*Gordon is going to answer, but then someone distracts him. It is a group of scientists. There are so many they don't fit on the screen. You cannot hear the conversation, but judging from their tone and attitude, you come to realize it's still too early for funerals. Gordon appears on the screen again. This time, he's even smiling.* C-Captain! Solar wind!! Strong solar wind along with the gravitational distortion of space!! Do you understand?!! It's so obvious, how did I not think of it myself!! Solar wind!! ;
;Gordon… Be quicker. We don't have a lot of time. ;6
6;Oh... r-r-right. Solar wind. There. It's very strong now, since the star is about to explode... *He coughs and looks embarrassed. He talks to the side.* Not explode, obviously, but I'm saying it like that so that our captain understands... right. *talking to the camera again.* And if we follow the strongest current, we can probably reach the edge of the system. And save ourselves. ;
;So like ships with sails?;7
7;A-a-almost. Something like that. If it makes it easier for you to understand. ;
;And how do we use this wind?;8
8;It won't be easy, but we have everything we need onboard. The hull of the Aurora 2 can't handle such punishment for prolonged periods of time... *Gordon taps his glasses.* But we should have enough time... There's no choice. Definitely none. This is the only way. Captain, the gusts of solar wind can be easily triangulated by our devices. All you have to do is follow them and accelerate. ;
;In that case, let's get to it. I hope… oh, damn it. I hope. Good luck, Gordon.;9
9;Good luck, Captain.;
;…;-1
