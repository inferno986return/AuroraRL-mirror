0;We've gotten a very important request... *Martan rummages around in the data on his tablet screen for about ten seconds.* It's from the European Alliance scientists. They were fighting about who was right and who was the most authorized to give you missions, and they've finally figured it out.;
;What is it?;1
1;Their radio telescope spotted a star nearby that, according to their data, should go supernova soon. They want you to investigate it. They're shouting over each other about how we only get a chance like that once every a million years. *Martan stops talking, waiting for your reaction. When he realizes there won't be one, he adds...* That is all. ;earth_puzzled_dialog
;So I just have to go there and get back? Is it dangerous? ;2
2;*Martan shrugs.* The scientists say that on the outside it's just a star, all the interesting things are happening inside. You as the captain won't be affected. ;earth_puzzled_dialog
;Okay. Send the coordinates to my Captain's terminal. Let's talk about other things. ;-1
