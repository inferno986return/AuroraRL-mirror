0;Okay, I'm ready to answer your questions regarding the objectives of your mission should you have any. Or we could go straight to the test mission.;
;I have some questions.;1
;Let's get to business.;6
1;*Martan looks at you expectantly.*;
;Could you repeat the main points of my mission? Maybe I missed something.;2
;What about the Aurora 1? A lot of people think our main task is finding it and rescuing it.;3
;What would happen to Earth if we didn't come back either?;4
;How will my work as captain be graded?;5
;I don't have any more questions.;6
2;*Martan rubs the bridge of his nose.* Okay, your main task is exploring uncharted stars and planets. The scientists have prepared some experimental projects and data collection programs for you, look through them when you have the time. Plus, everything you find in space, like anomalies, artefacts, everything unusual, - collect all of that and bring it to us. Of course, don't forget to use your ship labs to the max, but if your scientists can't handle something, it's okay. Here on Earth, we have a lot more research capabilities, so bring your findings here.;
;I still have questions.;1
;I understand it all, let's get to the test mission.;6
3;*Martan shakes his head.* Unfortunately, the probability of finding them is approaching zero. Of course, officially we announced that looking for the Aurora 1 is one of your tasks, but no one here seriously expects you to find it. Space is huge, and all we have is the approximate direction of their final flight and the coordinates of the first system they were going to visit. And they could be anywhere and in any form, like a bunch of debris orbiting some planet, or a cloud of vapor after a reactor explosion. Basically, try to find them, but not at the expense of the main goals of the project.;
;I still have questions.;1
;I understand it all, let's get to the test mission.;6
4;Nothing good. Project Aurora will probably be closed down, no one will risk building a third ship. And I shudder to imagine what will happen to humanity if it has no access to new technology and living space. So please try to come back.;
;I still have questions.;1
;I understand it all, let's get to the test mission.;6
5;Every time you come back, your progress will be graded. The amount of scientific data you will have brought will be calculated. A lot of data is good. Not a lot of data after a long flight is bad. Humanity cannot afford the luxury of utilizing your ship inefficiently. So if you bring back small amounts of data consistently, alas, we will have to let you go from the captain's post. Although, don't worry, I'm sure you'll handle this in the best possible way, it's no accident we picked you out among dozens of candidates.;
;I still have questions.;1
;I understand it all, let's get to the test mission.;6
6;Here's your misssion. The Iowa, a boxship that was written off, is waiting for you on the orbit of Mars. Your first task is checking the ship's combat systems. Destroy that ship. Just know that to make it more fun for you, they kind of... armed it.;
;Okay, my first objective is destroying a ship on Mars' orbit. What next?;7
7;Before getting destroyed, it will deploy a device that will land on the surface. It contains a small autonomous drone. Your second objective is to triangulate its position using your ship's scanners, deploy a landing party there, destroy the drone and get its debris.;
;And what do I need that trash for?;8
8;You'll find a black box in the debris. Don't worry, you won't damage it unless your landing party shoots rockets at it. There's an encoded key phrase in it. The code is pretty weak, your scientists will crack it in a couple of days. Tell me the key phrase, and that will be the end of your test.;
;Destroy the ship, shoot down the drone, look through the debris and decode the key phrase… did I miss anything?;9
9;No, you're right. For the duration of the test, you are forbidden from leaving the Solar system. When we're done with the checks, you're free and you can go wherever you want.;
;Great. I'll get to it.;-1
