0;*The ship's main lab is very light and noisy, it smells of electronics and coffee. There is a lot of people in white labcoats. Most of them have gathered around a big whiteboard, you can hear someone speaking quickly and emotionally there. As you come closer, you realize that all those people are listening to the Head of Laboratory, who is waving his hands pointing at the whiteboard and explaining something.* ;;;;
;Gordon!;3;;;
;*listen for a bit*;1;;;
1;...all of that is from the university curriculum, you understand? The cores decay instantly. And we have to mention another thing, I mean, it has the same... *writes down a formula on the whiteboard*... one half... instant decay... There. Same principle that alpha decay has. The logarithm of the cycle of life is proportionate to Z squared times A. Well, you understand, of course, what Z squared times A is. It's Z squared times A to the power of one third, R of the core... and there's A to the power of two thirds.;;;;
;Gordon!;3;;;
;*continue listening*;2;;;
2;This is the surface. That is, the relationship between the Coulombic energy and the surface parameters. These, as you all know, are the fissibility parameters. And if the electron gets more energy than what it needs to break away from the surface... *He waves his hands around. The scientists around him nod and whisper to each other.* What was the point of our argument? I'll say again, this is elementary! Kindergarten level! There! *Gordon takes off his glasses, makes a face and wipes them clean with a flap of his coat. He puts them back on, looks around the people gathered around him victoriously, and suddenly notices you.* And you are the... Ca... *stutters* Captain!;scientist_dialog_puzzled;;;
;Gordon.;3;;;
3;Captain! You're... *Gordon comes up to you and extends his hand for a handshake.* This is so... unexpected... I'm sorry. An argument about quantum physics arised with Mr Burukowsky... Doesn't matter... Why... I mean, what is the purpose of your visit? ;scientist_dialog_happy;;;
;Consider this an inspection, Gordon. Tell me a little about your lab.;4;;;
;Hm… I have a question. About you.;99;;;
;No, nothing important. I can see you're busy. I won't distract you any more. ;-1;;;
4;Ah… *Gordon nods and strokes his goatee.* The la… Ahem! The lab. Yeah. The Aurora 2 is outfitted with a very good lab… And staff… ;scientist_dialog_puzzled;;;
;Can you tell me more?;5;;;
5;Well... To make a comparison... Uh... *Gordon stutters more than he usually does. Either he's worried or he has problems with creative thinking. Probably the former.* We have... a great lab. Better than a lot of the ones on Earth. We can study any samples. Biological... mineral... synthetic... ahem... Even the most dangerous ones. ;scientist_dialog_puzzled;;;
;Great. What about the staff? Are you ready to work in unknown conditions? ;6;;;
6;Me personally? Well, I'm the Head of the Lab! And… Uh… That's not what you meant, is it? ;;;;
;Of course. I can't imagine you holding a rifle, Gordon.;7;;;
7;Of course... Well... The field staff is ready. They're great specialists, too, even though there isn't a single Ph.D. among them... *Gordon rubs the bridge of his nose.* They are well-trained, Captain. They're ready for scientific work and taking care of the equipment as well as combat action. ;scientist_dialog_puzzled;;;
;All right. Well, in that case, I won't distract you from work. Best of luck, Gordon. ;-1;;-1;
;Gordon, tell me about yourself.;8;;;
99;What? What question?;;;;
;Tell me something about yourself, Gordon.;8;;;
8;Uhm… Well… I have a Ph.D. in theoretical physics, captain. I am a certified microbiology professor... Worked at Lake Vostok... *Gordon lists all that in a bored and distracted voice.* I... What else can I tell you?;scientist_dialog_puzzled;;;
;How about how you ended up on the Aurora 2?;9;;;
9;*Gordon narrows his eyes and remains silent.* ;;;;
;What is it?;10;;;
10;I'm thinking about whether I can tell you about it… Yeah… I've worked with the defense industry, Captain. Took part in some experiments with... uhhh... Worlds with unusual physical conditions.;;;;
;Parallel worlds? Seriously?;11;;;
11;No! That's a misnomer! They aren't parallel! They're... *Gordon tries to explain it to you using his hands, saying something about Tegmark's classifications and the Lambda-CDM model.* There... Do you understand? The experiment consisted of three stages. Only two were implemented. ;;;;
;Tell me more about the experiment, Gordon. ;12;;;
;What about the third one?;13;;;
12;*Gordon shakes his head.* I can't, Captain. *Judging from the way he looks, he won't talk even if you torture him.* ;;;;
;Okay, then. What about the third stage?;13;;;
13;Canceled. The head of the project, Gabe... *Gordon sighs.* Gabe... *Suddenly, it is as if a dam broke inside Gordon. He jabbers on, his speech is heated and he sounds almost like a religious phanatic.* You don't understand!!! No one does! It's... different! A world where Pi equals four! A world that is a living cage! A world, where the Universe isn't even five billion years old!!! ;scientist_dialog_scared;;;
;Gordon…;14;;;
14;*Paying absolutely no attention to you and still gesticulating wildly, Gordon runs off to his office. You had better not bother him right now. Damn it. Mentally unstable, eccentric persona. Those geniuses... You should read his dossier.* ;scientist_dialog_scared;;;
;*go back to your office*;-1;;-1;parallel_worlds
