0;*Finding Sarah Frontz, the ship's Head Engineer, isn't an easy task. Her office is on the lower decks of the Aurora 2, so you have to cover a lot of ground before finding out that Sarah isn't there. You only find her a half-hour later, at Hyperspace Module 4 where she is busy calibrating the focusing array. The buzzing of the servo mechanisms that rotate the lenses is killing your ears. The whining of the mechanisms is accompanied by the screeching of the buffer and the beeping of fault detectors. Your nostrils are assaulted by the smell of grease.* ;;;;
;Sarah!!! Officer Frontz!!! ;1;;;
1;*You had to yell, but she heard you. Sarah screams something, too, but to one of the engineers working nearby, not to you.* Garrus! Go on without me! *And only then does she walk up to you. You leave the module.* Hello, Cap. I'm glad to see you, even though you distracted me. I'm sorry I'm... *She lifts her hands up, inviting you to take a look at her dirty overalls and gloves dripping sticky oil.* Well, you get it. Is this a social or a business visit?;;;;
;Business, of course. Consider this getting to know the ship and, of course, her crew. ;2;;;
;Social, pretty much. I just wanted to talk for a bit. ;9;;;
;It doesn't matter. In any case, I'll let you get back to work, officer. ;-1;;;
2;Oh… In that case, let's go to my office. I mean, we can't talk in the hallway, can we? *She takes off her gloves and throws them into the bin for single-use equipment. She moves elegantly. Her thin figure is a perfect fit for narrow maintenance hallways.* ;;;;
;I don't even know what to ask you. What should I know about my ship? ;3;;;
3;You? *She turns around and smiles. Her face is cute, even though you wouldn't call her conventionally beautiful. Take her slightly crooked nose: it's definitely been broken.* Well, you know... You don't really need to know anything about my neck of the woods. The hyper systems are working all right, we were just calibrating them. The gun batteries have been tested, they are now on standby. My staff is in perfect shape and ready to serve.;;;;
;The hyper systems?;4;;;
;I'd like to listen about the guns.;6;;;
;Yeah, let's talk about your staff. What can your people do? ;7;;;
;Okay, I get the picture. Sarah, tell me about yourself. ;9;;;
;Great. In that case, I'll let you get back to it. I have to go. ;17;;;
4;Yeah. They hyper systems. *Sarah looks at you with narrowed eyes.* Basically, it's that thing I was calibrating when you distracted me. When the time comes, it does a woobla-boobla-doo, *Sarah waves her hands around and makes a woobla-doobla-doo sound with a creepy voice*, and then our ship can go to deep space. By the way, it can only do it at the systems' borders, where the stars' gravity is the weakest.;;;;
;That's a great explanation.;5;;;
5;I wanted to become a teacher, but life turned out differently.;;;;
;I'd like to listen about the guns.;6;;;
;Yeah, let's talk about your staff. What can your people do? ;7;;;
;Okay, I get the picture. Sarah, tell me about yourself. ;9;;;
;Great. In that case, I'll let you get back to it. I have to go. ;17;;;
6;There's nothing to tell you, really. We have a laser. The laser is good. The best of what they do on Earth. I don't know what we might have to go up against, but we can give them a decent fight. ;;;;
;The hyper systems?;4;;;
;Yeah, let's talk about your staff. What can your people do? ;7;;;
;Okay, I get the picture. Sarah, tell me about yourself. ;9;;;
;Great. In that case, I'll let you get back to it. I have to go. ;17;;;
7;My people? You're the captain, they're YOUR people, heh. *Sarah smiles.* YOUR people can fix things. Or not. Well, basically, the engineering staff is responsible for the ship's normal operations, and for the technical aspect of planetary explorations. Procuring samples and all that. Should anything happen, they can fight against the enemy, but you're better off letting the soldiers deal with that, of course. Heh. You know, I get a gigantic grin every time I imagine our Garrus with a sniper rifle. Garrus, with a gun! Hahaha! ;;;;
;What's wrong with Garrus?;8;;;
8;He likes cats. And he's very quiet. Nevermind. ;;;;
;The hyper systems?;4;;;
;I'd like to listen about the guns.;6;;;
;Yeah, let's talk about your staff. What can your people do? ;7;;;
;Okay, I get the picture. Sarah, tell me about yourself. ;9;;;
;Great. In that case, I'll let you get back to it. I have to go. ;17;;;
9;Huh? That was unexpected. You can, uh... come in. *You have just gotten to her office, and Sarah opens the door. The office is medium-sized, there is a flag of Israel hanging from the wall. Directly below it is a photograph of a big family. The family really is big, you can't even find Sarah among the eleven children. Otherwise, nothing tells you that the office belongs to a woman.* What are you looking at, Captain? ;;;;
;I see you're from Israel.;10;;;
;You had a big family.;12;;;
;How did you end up on the Aurora, Sarah?;15;;;
;Nothing. You know, I have to go. I have some things to do. ;17;;;
10;Yep. *Sarah nods, you can clearly hear pride in her voice.* One of the last independent states on the planet. ;;;;
;And by the dependent ones you obviously mean the three unions. ;11;;;
11;*Sarah looks at her shoes and blushes.* Well… that's not what I wanted to say. I just liked feeling like someone in particular, not another screw in a huge mechanism. ;;;;
;You had a big family.;12;;;
;How did you end up on the Aurora, Sarah?;15;;;
;Nothing. You know, I have to go. I have some things to do. ;17;;;
12;Dad, Mom, five brothers and five sisters. I'm the sixth. Well, have you found me yet? Maybe you should look for some distinguishing mark? ;;;;
;Like a broken nose?;13;;;
13;Hah! You're very observant, Cap. *Sarah shakes her head.* But no, I broke my nose in the army. I fell asleep atop some armor and fell down. ;;;;
;The army? I knew even girls served in Israel, but…;14;;;
14;*She shrugs indiffirently in response.* As if that's a bad thing. ;;;;
;I see you're from Israel.;10;;;
;How did you end up on the Aurora, Sarah?;15;;;
;Nothing. You know, I have to go. I have some things to do. ;17;;;
15;Oh... *Suddenly, Sarah adopts a whining, almost childish tone, and starts to jabber.* Caaaap! I don't like talking about that. The army, the university, the Academy of Sciences, a bunch of patents for the MoD, and here I am. All you have to know is that I'm a great engineer. If you want details, take a look at my dossier. ;;;;
;Too bad. I'd like to hear about it.;16;;;
16;How about some other time?;;;;
;I see you're from Israel.;10;;;
;You had a big family.;12;;;
;Nothing. You know, I have to go. I have some things to do. ;17;;;
17;So soon? Too bad. I wanted to discuss something, but… *Sarah looks disappointed* …but the Captain is very busy, of course. ;;;;
;What's wrong?;18;;;
18;Weeell… I'm not happy with the standard officer's ration. ;;;;
;What about it?;19;;;
19;The ration makes me... *she looks embarrassed* well... *she blushes* well, it makes my stomach ache! There. And they refuse to change the ration without your approval. They're saying that I'm asking for food from the special stock, but they're probably just being lazy. Like, if the medics let it pass, it means it's nothing serious, it'll do. ;;;;
;In that case, I have an idea. How about we have dinner together and talk it over? ;20;;;
;All right, officer Frontz, I will deal with this complaint. Good luck. ;-1;;-1;
20;Dinner together?;;;;
;Dinner together. Not right now, of course, we're both terribly busy at the moment, but a bit later... And you can have some food from the captain's ration while you're at it. They say it's pretty good. ;21;;;
21;"*Sarah looks at you playfully and smiles.* That's funny, Cap. They call that ""being a smooth operator,"" right? *Her smile widens.* Of course I'd like that.";;;;
;Great, then.;-1;;-1;engineer_dinner
