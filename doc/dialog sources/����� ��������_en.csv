0;Greetings, the human commander. I'm glad to see you on our space station. What do you want?;;;;
;I want to trade with you.;-1;;1;
;I want to trade with you. By the way, I have a 10 percent discount and I want to use it right now.;-1;klisk.discount;2;
;You've mentioned planets, which we can colonize.;16;klisk.planet_info=0 && !planet_info;;
;I'm interested in getting the coordinates of the capitals of the other races.;2;!klisk.coordinates_traded;;klisk.coordinates_traded
;I want to talk about...;3;;;
;Nothing special. My crew needs some rest, so I decided to dock to the safe and quiet space station.;-1;;;
2;Sure. Everything we've talked about is already sent to you. Will you give me some information about your civilization?;;;;
;No, I'd rather talk about it later. I'm sorry.;4;;;
;Well, I guess so. But I can give you only superficial information.;5;;;base_info
;Sure. You'll find all the information you need in this folder.;6;;;full_info
4;What a shame. But it's all up to you, the human commander. The Trading Codex gives the right to do what you think is necessary. Do you need something else on our space station?;;;;
;Thank you. Yes, I need one more thing.;0;;;
;Unfortunately, I have no time. Thank you and good luck. Open the airlock door!;-1;;;
5;What type of information are you interested in?;;;;
;I want to know more about the borks.;7;!klisk.bork_info;100;klisk.bork_info
;I'd like to know more about your people.;7;!klisk.klisk_info;200;klisk.klisk_info
;What can you say about the rogues?;7;!klisk.rogues_info;300;klisk.rogues_info
;Tell me about the zorsans. It's an empire! Sounds interesting.;7;!klisk.zorsan_info;400;klisk.zorsan_info
;Neither. I'd like to get credits.;10;;500;small_reward
;Can you say anything about the gardeners?;8;;;
8;*refusing cracking* Unfortunately, I can't do that. The first reason is that we know nothing about the gardeners. The second reason is that they don't have any diplomatic relationships with the other races. You'll have to choose something else.;;;;
;Well, I guess I have no other choice, but to choose something else.;5;;;
7;It's a good decision. The information is sent to your computer. Do you need something else?;;;;
;Yes, I'd like to use the services of your station.;0;;;
;No, it's time for me to go. It was a good trade.;9;;;
9;The codex tells us that the good trade makes us better, whilst the bad one brings harm to both of us. Good luck, the human commander. I'll order to open the airlock doors for you.;;;;
;...;-1;;;
10;It's one strange decision, but who am I to judge? During the first trade you can use the cash money, but I highly recommend you to open an account in our bank.;;;;
;The klisk bank?;11;;;
11;Yes. Our bank is really reliable. We use the Trading Codex to close any deal.;;;;
;I'll think about it tomorrow.;12;;;
12;Have you got anything else or should I ask to open an airlock?;;;;
;Yes, I have a few questions.;0;;;
;No, I'd rather fly away. Thank you. It was a decent trade.;-1;;;
3;I'm all yours, what do you want?;;;;
;We have met a strange creature. It looked like a Klisk but it was not a Kilsk. It even did not seem to be sapient.;120;heritage.monster_collected && !heritage.quest_started && !heritage.quest_completed;;
;I found a strange blue sphere on the spaceship. Apparently, it is alive , but we don't know how to communicate with it. Can you help us out?;105;energy_sphere.started=0;;
;No-no, nothing. I was mistaken. Let's talk about something else.;0;;;
6;What information package do you want to receive for this?;;;;
;The borks.;14;!klisk.bork_info;100;klisk.bork_info
;Let's talk about the klisks.;14;!klisk.klisk_info;200;klisk.klisk_info
;I'd go with the rogues.;14;!klisk.rogues_info;300;klisk.rogues_info
;Tell me more about the zorsans.;14;!klisk.zorsan_info;400;klisk.zorsan_info
;What's up with the gardeners?;13;;;
;Nothing. I'd prefer to get the money.;10;;500;large_reward
13;They don't have any diplomatic relationships with the other races, so there is almost no information about them. You have to choose something else.;;;;
;What a shame. I was really looking forward to receiving that information. But that's okay. Could you please repeat the whole list?;6;;;
14;That's a good decision. I'll send the information on your computer. What should we do with your bonus?;;;;
;Cash it out.;15;;500;small_reward
;Give me one more information package.;5;;;
15;As you say, commander. Do you want to look on what you can spend your money on?;;;;
;Why not? What services does your station provide?;0;;;
;You know, I'm not that interested in it. Unfortunately, I have to go. But it was a good trade!;17;;;
17;I'm happy that you think so. Good luck, the human commander.;;;;
;...;-1;;;
16;Yes. I'm sending the information. Done. Keep in mind that the creatures of this planet are not the best neighbours in the galaxy. But it's well worth it.;;;;
;My race is used to wars.;18;;;planet_info
18;Is it good or bad? There is no right answer. But it's irrelevant. Does our station have something else you're interested in?;;;;
;Sure. What services do you provide?;0;;;
;Unfortunately, no. The government insists on the fast and effective actions. And the 'fast' is the key word in this context. Over.;-1;;;
105;Well, we can do that... *the klisk laughs* It all depends on what intentions and plans you have. I can explain what it is even for free, but you'll have to pay me, if you want to get any other kind of help.;;;;
;Okay. What is it?;106;;;
;Why doesn't it communicate with us?;107;;;
;Why did it stick to our research console?;108;;;
;Can the sphere harm my spaceship or my crew?;109;;;
;I need it to leave my spaceship.;110;;;
;What do you mean under 'any other kind of help'?;112;;;
;I don't think that I need anything right now. See you later. Over.;-1;;;
106;The blue sphere is the blue sphere. It's alive. It's a sphere of energy that has its own mind. There are lot of such spheres in the Universe.;;;;
;Why doesn't it communicate with us?;107;;;
;Why did it stick to our research console?;108;;;
;Can the sphere harm my spaceship or my crew?;109;;;
;I need it to leave my spaceship.;110;;;
;What do you mean under 'any other kind of help'?;112;;;
;I don't think that I need anything right now. See you later. Over.;-1;;;
107;Its thoughts are really different from ours, commander. It doesn't think that it is worth communicating with the organic forms of life, because you're like stars or meteorites for its perception. Do you try to communicate with meteorites, commander? I don't think so.;;;;
;Okay. What is it?;106;;;
;Why did it stick to our research console?;108;;;
;Can the sphere harm my spaceship or my crew?;109;;;
;I need it to leave my spaceship.;110;;;
;What do you mean under 'any other kind of help'?;112;;;
;I don't think that I need anything right now. See you later. Over.;-1;;;
108;Such spheres, as you have already understood, is a battery of some sort. If they want to stay alive, they need to find some kind of mechanism or electronic device, which they can charge.;;;;
;Okay. What is it?;106;;;
;Why doesn't it communicate with us?;107;;;
;Can the sphere harm my spaceship or my crew?;109;;;
;I need it to leave my spaceship.;110;;;
;What do you mean under 'any other kind of help'?;112;;;
;I don't think that I need anything right now. See you later. Over.;-1;;;
109;The sphere doesn't communicate with any form of organic life. It doesn't even notice you. As for the spaceship... *the klisk thinks about something* I think he might.;;;;
;Okay. What is it?;106;;;
;Why doesn't it communicate with us?;107;;;
;Why did it stick to our research console?;108;;;
;I need it to leave my spaceship.;110;;;
;What do you mean under 'any other kind of help'?;112;;;
;I don't think that I need anything right now. See you later. Over.;-1;;;
110;Well, you can do it only by throwing out the device itself with the sphere from your spaceship?;;;;
;Are you serious? Is there any other way?;111;;;
111;I don't think so. *you hear his sympathizing cracking*;;;;
;Okay. What is it?;106;;;
;Why doesn't it communicate with us?;107;;;
;Why did it stick to our research console?;108;;;
;Can the sphere harm my spaceship or my crew?;109;;;
;I need it to leave my spaceship.;110;;;
;What do you mean under 'any other kind of help'?;112;;;
;I don't think that I need anything right now. See you later. Over.;-1;;;
112;Well, I can communicate with the sphere. It is really hard and expensive. It'll cost you 6 credits.;;;;
;Can you do it for free?;116;;;
;Okay. Here's your money.;113;credits>6;;
113;Commander, I do warn you! *you hear the loud and monotonous cracking* The chances of success are really low! I don't think that the sphere will leave your spaceship, you're wasting your money!;;;;
;Just take my money and do it!;115;;;
;Okay, let's forget about it. But what else can I do?;114;;;
114;Well, you have two options, the human commander. You can either put up with stowaway on your spaceship or... And, come again, to what thing did it stick to? To your research console, eh? I suppose losing this console will be a tragedy to you.;;;;
;And, once again, what did you say about free help?;116;;;
;That's all for now. Over.;-1;;;
116;Ask your questions, the human commander.;;;;
;Okay. What is it?;106;;;
;Why doesn't it communicate with us?;107;;;
;Why did it stick to our research console?;108;;;
;Can the sphere harm my spaceship or my crew?;109;;;
;I need it to leave my spaceship.;110;;;
;What do you mean under 'any other kind of help'?;112;;;
;I don't think that I need anything right now. See you later. Over.;-1;;;
115;Okay. Open the airlock, I'm going to you.;;;;
;Sure. We're waiting. Over.;-1;;101;
120;Very interesting. Looks like a Klisk but is not a Klist? What did you do with it?;;;;
;We had to kill it. It attacked us with some sort of acid and we had no choice.;121;;;
121;Killing a Klisk is a major crime, captain. However we do not use any acid, so this is probably not a Klisk. Can I see any information about it? ;;;;
;Yes, sending you the data collected by our scientists…;122;;;
;I think I will keep this data for now.;123;;;
122;*A few fast cracks* Thank you, I will pass it to our analytics. Please wait a bit.;;;;
;<wait>;-1;;128;
123;As you wish. Anything else?;;;;
;Yes, I have more business to do…;0;;;
;No, I have to leave.;-1;;;
