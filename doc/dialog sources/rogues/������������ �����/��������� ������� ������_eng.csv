0;*the connection is very bad* Unknown ship?! Unknown ship?! Help code, hot! Help code, hot! I repeat, help code, hot! Help code, hot!;;;
;Yeah, yeah, I remember, hot. It's us again.;24;rogues.damaged_scout_found;
;What does the code mean?;1;!rogues.damaged_scout_found;
1;The generator is busted! The normalization system has frozen, the main generator is going to blow up soon! And our life support is at minimum, to boot! We're all at the cargo hold, we've turned off service to all other rooms, but we still really need help! Please! We may only have hours left!;;;
;Of course, I'll try to help. What do you need?;2;;
;Hm… Your ship is big. Is it military or a transport ship?;5;;
;How did that even happen, guys?;8;;
2;There are several hull breaches! We need to fix them, at least for some time, to let us get to our equipment!;;;
;Gordon, Sarah, what do you say?;21;;
21;Well, Cap, going by my estimates, they'll need 10 resource units to patch over the main breaches. We could send it over with a drone, so that we don't endanger our shuttle crew. Or we could try to take them out of there on our shuttle, but that's dangerous, their ship could go boom at any moment.;engineer_dialog;;
;Gordon, your opinion?;22;;
22;Miss Frontz, as an engineer, is probably more qualified to tell you about the danger of flying to their ship. I can only say that I would very much like an opportunity to talk to people of that race face-to-face. Especially when they can't leave…;scientist_dialog;;
;Gordon, are you trying to tell me you want to experiment on them?;23;;
;Got it. Connect me with their ship again.;24;;
23;N-no, of course not. Just talk. Well, maybe submit them to some psychological test. But only if they agree!;scientist_dialog;;
;Your call. Connect me with the Rogues again.;24;;
24;*The Rogues looks at you through the static pleadingly.*;;;
;Right… I have the resources you need. I'm sending them to you on a drone. Hold on in there.;-1;;1
;Damn it. I don't have the resources. Any ideas?;3;;
;Tell me again what happened to your ship.;1;;
3;Just do something already! Please!!!;;;
;Only one solution springs to mind: we could try to get to you on a shuttle and evacuate your ship.;4;;
;Tell me again what happened to your ship.;1;;
;I need to disconnect for a second to ask my officers for advice. Over and out.;-1;;
4;We only have one working compartment! The rest are full of vacuum, there's no air! Don't do it! Try to pass our coordinates to some nearby station instead!;;;
;Uh, no. You said you only had hours left yourself. So get ready. I'm sending the shuttle. Over and out.;-3;;2
;All right, all right! I'm coming to the nearest station. Hold on in there.;-1;;
;Tell me again what happened to your ship.;1;;
5;What?! What a stupid question! Why now?!;;;
;Damn it, you're right… What happened to your ship?;1;;
;Look, I asked you a question. Answer it and don't waste our time. The sooner you answer, the sooner we'll be done.;6;;
;No reason. Look, there are some… problems. Yeah, problems. I'll disconnect for a bit. Over and out.;-1;;
6;All right, all right!! Heavy transport, bioactive materials, medicine, medicinal narcotics... I don't remember it myself!!! I don't know!!! Help us!!!;;;
;Yeah, of course. Come on, tell me what's wrong with your ship.;1;;
;Pipe down. Is the cargo valuable?;7;;
;What? The reception is really bad! I can't read you! I'll disconnect and take care of the line, wait a bit.;-1;;
7;What do you think?!! Help us!!;;;
;Sure. How do I do it?;1;;
;I have to disconnect for a bit. I'll be right back. Over and out.;-1;;
8;Those dumbass Borks!!! Three flying tin cans made out of trash and crap!! They tried to ram us!;;;
;Wow. That's hardcore. How do I help you?;1;;
;Hm. So the Borks really wanted your cargo?;9;;
9;*There is some static. From the word fragments you can hear, the answer is yes.* …eaning to attack us yourself?!!;;;
;Right. Tell me, how do I help you?;1;;
;Hm. You know what, I'll disconnect for a bit. Don't go anywhere.;-1;;
