1;R-r-right. Of course. It's just… It was risky, human captain. My name is Hoorkata Famrana. I am in your debt.;
;Don't, Hoorkata. You don't say thanks for such things. Where do I take you?;3
;Speaking of debts. Do you think my efforts deserve to be rewarded somehow?;2
2;Human captain, I'm sorry, but my ship has been destroyed. I'm bankrupt. But if you take me to the closest Rogue station, they'll pay you for sure.;
;My scientists want to talk to you a bit. Would you mind?;4
;A Rogue station? Sure. Make yourself at home.;-1
3;Human captain, I don't want to be a liability any more than I have to. Take me to the closest Rogue station. That will be enough. You've done so much already.;
;My scientists want to talk to you a bit. Would you mind?;4
;A Rogue station? Sure. Make yourself at home.;-1
4;I'll be honored. It's the least I can do to thank you for saving our lives.;
;Great. Henry, let your boys take our guests to Science.;5
