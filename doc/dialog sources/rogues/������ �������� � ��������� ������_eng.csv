0;*You pass a security checkpoint. By the way, the guards look much more impressive than regular Rogues. They're tall, muscular, and have massive implants in their arms and their eyes. They eye you suspiciously, but still let you through as soon as Foornoot tells them to. Beyond the checkpoint there are gates and a massive tall fence. Once past them, you drive into a small park and down a small alley towards a tall building ahead of you. There are a lot of statues on both sides of the road, depicting various Rogues. Two things set each of them apart from the rest: one, they all look old, two, they all have implants in their heads.*;alien_city_dialog;
;What are those statues, Foornoot?;1;
1;Those are the, uhh… *Foornoot is a bit at a loss.* Respected figures. Some of them are respected for serving the Devourer. Some of them, because of their actions towards good and peace. Some of them are decorated military leaders.;rogues_dialog;
;Serving the Devourer? I cannot even imagine.;2;
;Which ones are the military leaders?;4;
;Good and peace? Tell me about some of them.;6;
;*stay silent and wait*;9;
2;It's fairly simple, human captain. Take Ka, for example. *He points towards the statue closest to you, depicting an old man in a long robe and with an implant that reminds you of some kind of weird helmet.* He discovered and formulated the concept of the Essence of the Devourer. The Essence of the Devourer is the eternal, changeable first principle, created by the Devourer out of the contents of our world, through devouring it.;alien_city_dialog;
;Oh… That's hard to grasp. I think I have to know more about your religion.;3;
3;*Foornoot smiles.* It's not a religion.;rogues_dialog;
;If you say so. Which ones are the military leaders?;4;
;You said something about people working towards good and peace.;6;
4;Sure. Hoombata. *The statue doesn't look very old.* This is from our modern history. Fifty years ago, he crushed Zorsan forces despite the enemy outnumbering his forces four to one.;alien_city_dialog;
;Oh. I see the Zorsan have had time to skirmish with virtually every developed species.;5;
5;What can you do? I'm sure they'll change.;rogues_dialog;
;Tell me something about those respected for serving the Devourer.;2;
;You said something about people working towards good and peace.;6;
6;Oh… Look. *There is a statue of a bald Rogue with an implant that looks like a pair of glasses.* Horshak. A great teacher. When the Zorsan suddenly attacked a peaceful transport, he tried to save his students who were flying with him. Some of them, he managed to save. The others, he couldn't. He couldn't save himself, either.;rogues_dialog;
;That's sad. I'm sorry.;7;
7;He was a great Rogue. *Foornoot tilts his head to the right.*;rogues_dialog;
;You can be proud of him.;8;
8;That's right. Were you interested in something else? We're almost there. If you want to ask something, make it quick.;rogues_dialog;
;Tell me about the adepts of the Devourer.;2;
;The military leaders.;4;
;No, I've asked all I wanted already.;9;
9;*The limo drives up to a high porch. Foornoot gets out first and opens the doors for the rest. When everyone is out of the car, it disappears behind the house. The garage must be there. Foornoot walks up to the door and opens it.* Come in.;alien_city_dialog;
;…;10;
10;*You walk inside and find yourself in a very busy building. Rogues are running around, some of them have implants, some don't. Several Borks are speaking loudly, there is a guard Rogue (one of the tall ones), his eyes are full of sadness. A fat Klisk is descending from the second floor, breathing heavily, his antigrav is humming queitly. Foornoot touches you on the shoulder lightly.* We're going to the second floor. Your people better stay here.;interior_dialog;
;Of course.;11;
11;*The second floor is much quieter. It's just public servants going in and out of the office. Foornot stops next to one of the entrances and points to the door.* This is you, human captain. I wish you luck.;interior_dialog;
;Thanks, Foornoot. You too.;12;
12;*He nods and walks away. You come in.*;interior_dialog;
;…;13;
13;*The room you're in is pretty small. It is because most of it is taken up by some humming mechanical contraption with blinking lights and transparent tubes full of pumped liquids. An old and thin Rogue whose head is connected to the machine with thick black wires greets you sitting down. It is obvious he cannot get up.* Human captain? You. I've found about you already. I've gotten the information from your ship... *The lights start blinking faster. The machine hums weakly.*;;
;Elder Hoor?;14;
14;*The Rogue nods. The wires sqeak a little.*;;
;Um… Sorry for asking, but how do you live with that thing? I mean… how do you eat, for example… or sleep?;15;
;You said you'd gotten the information. What is your decision?;21;
;To be honest, I did my homework before coming here, and found some information about you. But I wasn't expecting this.;16;klisk.rogues_info
15;*Hoor smiles weakly.* They disconnect the wires when my work hours end.;;
;You said you'd gotten the information. What is your decision?;21;
;To be honest, I did my homework before coming here, and found some information about you. But I wasn't expecting this.;16;klisk.rogues_info
16;Well, then, you got an incomplete package. You can't just find out everything about us. But the action itself is admirable. *It is hard to talk to Hoor, he is extremely unemotional. It must because of the machine connected to his head.*;;
;What is admirable about it if the data I bought isn't complete?;17;
17;You shouldn't have expected much. Did you buy it from the Klisks? Next time, try to formulate your requests according to their Code. If you bought it from the Borks, only buy from the genetically intelligent ones. And the Zorsan... No. You couldn't have bought it from the Zorsan.;;
;Klisk Code?;18;
;Borks' genetical intelligence?;19;
;Why couldn't I have bought it from the Zorsan?;20;
;You said you'd gotten the information. What is your decision?;21;
18;The Code of Commerce that guides their business and regulates their private lives. It's a strange thing. Illogical.;;
;Borks' genetical intelligence?;19;
;Why couldn't I have bought it from the Zorsan?;20;
;You said you'd gotten the information. What is your decision?;21;
19;Sixty percent of Borks are stupid. It's their genetic trait.;;
;Klisk Code?;18;
;Why couldn't I have bought it from the Zorsan?;20;
;You said you'd gotten the information. What is your decision?;21;
20;It's an empire full of unhealthy chauvinism and nationalism. They don't cooperate with almost anybody.;;
;Klisk Code?;18;
;Borks' genetical intelligence?;19;
;You said you'd gotten the information. What is your decision?;21;
21;*The machine you won't go as far as to call an implant hums a bit louder. The lights become brighter, some of them blink. Hoor closes his eyes. Hoor opens his eyes.* In the future, our cooperation could prove advantageous. Now... you... you'll have to catch up. Yes. I... *The machine hums.* Us. We agree.;;
;I didn't expect it to be over so soon.;22;
22;My calculations are correct. If we cooperate, in just a few years our pace of development will grow significantly. Our technology is different. But that is a good thing.;;
;Well, then… I'm glad. When should we expect your representative on Earth?;23;
23;*The lights blink, the machine hums.* In a month. He will be there… in a month. A regular Rogue, not like me. Without… *he points to the machine* this.;;
;That is good.;-1;
