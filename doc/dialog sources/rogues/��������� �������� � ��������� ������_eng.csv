0;*Hoor looks at you, his eyes cloudy. The machine hums and blinks.* Oh… you. What do you want?;;;;
;I managed to obtain the necessary data. I didn't risk transferring it, I took it here on the source drive.;1;rogues.zorsan_data;;
;Yes, there is something. A small group of Rogues is going to pray on my planet's satellite. It causes natural catastrophes on our planet. Your compatriots won't leave. The leader said I could provide them with everything necessary and speed up the process, but your order would convince them, too.;25;rogues_altar.moon_checked;;
;One of your ships is going to crash. The situation is dire.;200;rogues.damaged_scout_found;;
;I have some Rogues with me. They were in a crash, I saved them.;205;rogues.damage_scout_crew_saved;;
;We are ready to pay the fine.;100;rogues.fine;;
;There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. In two years, but still, we can't defend ourselves alone. We need your support.;28;zorsan.war_preparations;;
;No, I didn't want anything. Just a courtesy visit.;-1;;;
1;*Hoor's eyes become clearer. The machine hums louder. He extends his hand to you.*;;;;
;Here you go.;4;rogues.zorsan_data=forged;;
;Here you go.;2;rogues.zorsan_data=real;;
2;*Hoor plays with the drive, then finds the correct port in the machine by touch and inserts the device. He is silent for a couple of minutes, with his eyes closed. When he opens them, Hoor speaks.* I regret it, but there is no danger of their attacking us. We cannot help you, human captain.;;;;
;But… We risked so much getting that data!;3;;;
;Okay. That's too bad.;-1;;;
3;*The machine stops humming, Hoor smiles.* And? *It's pointless to ask him again.*;;;;
;Okay. That's too bad.;-1;;;
4;*Hoor plays with the drive, then finds the correct port in the machine by touch and inserts the device. He is silent for a couple of minutes, with his eyes closed. When he opens them, Hoor speaks.* We... didn't expect that. We didn't. But the data speaks for itself. But there is little of it. *Apparently, Hoor isn't talking to you.* But they... no. There have been precedents. We cannot afford another incident with another Horshak... And if... *Hoor twitches.* No! No! No!! No!!!;;;;
;Elder Hoor?!;5;;;
5;"*Hoor is shaking, but every next twitch is weaker than the one before it. In the end, he blinks and looks at you with his slightly cloudy, but intelligent eyes; there is a spark of consciousness in them.* We will help you. We... we will help you. Blueprints and spare parts that will help you build more advanced ships. I will give the order. They will be given to you.";;;;
;That's good. Are you sure you're okay?;6;;;war_help
6;*Hoor doesn't pay any attention to your question.* Was there anything else?;;;;
;No, I didn't want anything. We've discussed everything I wanted. I have to go.;-1;;;
25;*Hoor answers surprisingly quickly.* They are doing mass. Their leader is getting ready to walk the path of an Elder. It is a very important thing for him. If I delay his mass... he won't be able to do another one for a very long time. If you helped him... that would make him very grateful to you. A future Elder being grateful to you...;;;;
;Is that so? In that case, I really do think I'd better handle it myself.;26;;;
;My planet can't wait. I'm sorry, but I'll have to ask you to recall him.;27;;;rogues_altar.withdraw
26;Good decision… Is there anything else?;;;;
;No, there isn't. Our business is concluded. I have to go.;-1;;;
;There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. In two years, but still, we can't defend ourselves alone. We need your support.;28;zorsan.war_preparations;;
27;I'll send a courier to him. Is there anything else?;;;;
;No, there isn't. Our business is concluded. I have to go.;-1;;;
;There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. In two years, but still, we can't defend ourselves alone. We need your support.;28;zorsan.war_preparations;;
28;*The machine barely hums. Hoor answers after a while.* No. We cannot afford a new conflict with the Zorsan.;;;;
;But listen, if you don't help us, you'll lose a potentially profitable cooperation!;29;;;
29;And I'll minimize the risk of another conflict with a powerful enemy.;;;;
;Has it crossed your mind that a conflict is inevitable? When they're done with us, the Zorsan may attack you.;31;;;
31;*Hoor opens his mouth, but then closes it instantly. The machine starts humming, boiling, and blinking. It goes on for a good five minutes. Hoor is shaking rather noticeably. His red suit is trembling on his stomach from his strong pulse.*;;;;
;…;32;;;
32;*Finally, he answers. He speaks very slowly.* Chance... Possibility... There is one. Not enough data. We need more. If you want our final decision, you have to obtain it.;;;;
;We already have the information.;1;rogues.zorsan_data;;
;"I could do it, but how? ""Getting information"" is too simple of an expression for this case.";33;;;
33;Zorsan objects have it. Ships. The important thing is, if the information goes missing and the objects potentially get damaged, it may provoke them to attack sooner. Also, if the information does not contain any data that proves that there is a chance of their attacking us, we will have to decline.;;;;
;Wow. Is there anything else you want to add?;34;;;
34;In case you fail, we will deny everything.;;;;
;Of course. Let's see if we can find something.;-1;;;zorsan.quest
100;Great. You have to pay ${rogues.fine} credits.;;;;
;Here you go.;-1;;100;
;I think we'll pay another time.;-1;;;
200;*The machine bleeps, Hoor speaks quietly.* Coordinates?;;;;
;They are being transferred.;203;;;
;Wait. I'd like a reward for my help.;201;;;
201;By the Devourer, do I look like a Bork? First the data, then the money.;;;;
;Damn it. Okay. I'm transferring it.;203;;;
;Uh, no. First the money, then the data.;202;;;
202;Mistrust… Refusal… *Hoor closes his eyes, the machine stops blinking and beeping. The Rogue breathes, but doesn't react to any stimuli. You better visit him another time.*;;;;
;…;-1;;;
203;Help is on its way. You… will be rewarded.;;;;
;How big is the reward?;204;;;
204;*Hoor doesn't answer. Apparently, he doesn't intend to, either.*;;;;
;…;-1;;200;
205;*The mysterious machine stops beeping. Hoor's face jerks.* You… yes… saved… *Hoor frowns.* What do you want in return?;;;;
;In return? No, thank you. I just saved your compatriots.;-1;;201;
;I like the way you think! I wouldn't say no to money.;206;;;
206;*Hoor's face softens. But he is still frowning.* Five credits. No… more.;;;;
;Well, that's better than nothing. Happy to be working with you. Good luck.;-1;;202;
