0;*Establishing a connection with the station is surprisingly hard. After almost an entire hour, you finally manage to do it. The static is over, the connection is established.*;;;
;Circumstellar station, come in. This is the captain of the Aurora 2 ship, homeport Earth.;1;;
1;"*There is a beep of data being transferred. The text is transmitted automatically.* ""Whoever you are, this beacon is property of the Rogues. It is uninhabited. This place is a sacred cemetery, where the best of the best have found their rest: the Higher Elders, who gave their lives to the Essence of the Essence of the Devourer a long time ago. If you are Rogue, bow to them and go. If you are foreign, just keep flying. Know that even things that are not alive can defend themselves.""";;;
;Uh-huh. So that's how it is. Gordon, what do you say?;2;;
2;*Gordon reports on a secure line.* Captain, we've scanned the beacon! There is something…;;;
;Report.;3;;
3;The equipment is old, even decrepit... apart from the defense systems!!! There are no signs of life, but I think those are the results of special scanning... Now. The most important thing! According to my data, this beacon, through some unknown means, turns solar radiation into energy!! Do you understand? It is charged by hard radiation, while using it to shield itself against it, providing itself with an existence!!;;;
;I got it. You also think that the technology would be useful on Earth?;4;;
4;Of course, Captain! You're reading my mind! Our solar energy technology isn't effective enough yet, but the tech at the beacon seems to be very advanced.;;;
;This is what Earth needs. A system like that would cause something like a planetary celebration. Imagine that, a station that can make cheap energy from solar radiation…;7;;
7;An utopia, Captain… On the other hand, those who build this stracture will probably try to find those who desecrated their shrine. Oh, and could we try to get the technology from the Rogues peacefully?;;;
;What do you think?;5;;
5;I… *Gordon stutters again.* I-I can't say. You're the captain. You decide.;;;
;Well, then. I think it's worth it. After all, only the dead are here, and those who are still alive need help. There is a peaceful solution, I know, but we just don't have enough time. Not even close. We have to do everything quietly and neatly. Henry, get your people ready.;6;;
;I think we better leave it alone and contend ourselves with long-rance scanning. Not that I care about some alien mummies, but I don't exactly want to ruin my relationship with their live brethren, either.;-1;;0
;No. A cemetery is a cemetery, whoever owns it. Apparently, heroes are buried here. We can't just violate a place that is sacred for another people. It's not about powerful defenses, it's about being human. We can't act like wild barbarians.;-1;;0
6;My people are always ready, Captain.;marine_dialog;;
;Go on, then. Begin the operation.;-1;;1
