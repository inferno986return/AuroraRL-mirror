1;Sure. And I like talking to people. Take officer Liszkiewicz, he's not like that, he's introverted. The scientists are the only ones who can really understand Gordon. And I like to run around, talk to the servicemen or the enlisted men.;

2;*Sarah points behind her back, at the bedside table with a big stack of books on it. Mostly books with names in Hebrew, but there are also regular fiction books.* I mostly have my own, but I borrow some books, too. Sometimes it's sci-fi, sometimes it's murder mysteries. Lots of genres.;

3;Oh, you know, over here it's… Wow! The movie theater, and the books! Last week they showed To The Moon, have you seen it? The movie about the old man and the two doctors.;

6;Yeah, I like cooking. Make cookies, or something from the Jewish cuisine… You know, it's a bit like fixing engines, except your hands don't get as dirty.;
;I didn't really expect something like that from you.;7
7;Well you were wrong! *snorts* I was the best cook in my family. Twelve eaters can't be wrong.;
