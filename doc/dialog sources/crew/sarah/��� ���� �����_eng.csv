0;Sad to hear that. *Sarah droops a bit.* Is it really bad?;
;Maybe. I think we need to ask other aliens for help. That could help us.;1
1;What, we can't take the Zorsan on by ourselves?;
;The chances of that are exceedingly low.;2
;I don't know, Sarah. In any case, with outside help we'll have less casualties.;3
;What is that nonsense? Of course we can!;4
2;That's pretty glum thinking, Cap. But at least you're honest. *Sarah shivers.*;engineer_dialog_puzzled
;Are you afraid?;5
3;Yeah. But still, many people will die…;engineer_dialog_puzzled
;Are you afraid?;5
4;I think you're being a bit cock sure, Cap… *Sarah shivers.* I wish I could be like that.;engineer_dialog_puzzled
;Are you afraid?;5
5;I… I'm… unfomfortable. I imagined all that to me, and… Zorsan really know how to fight! What's going to happen to us?;
;I already told you what I was going to do. Don't panic prematurely, Sarah.;6
6;Cap, are you really… *Sarah looks like she's about to go into hysterics.*;engineer_dialog_puzzled
;Frontz! This is an order. Calm down.;7
7;Yes… of course…;
;Calm down and don't panic. Nothing has happened yet, we don't know know anything. Get a grip. If this happens again, I'll have them prescribe you tranquilizers.;8
8;*Sarah nods.* I beg your pardon. *She still looks disturbed, but more lively than a couple of minutes ago.* You're right. It was an attack.;
;That's great. Try not to take it so close to your heart. Over and out.;-1
