0;Got you, Captain. And about Gordon, well… weirdly enough, he's a typical scientist. Too typical, even. ;;;
;Too typical?;1;;
1;*Henry nods.* He acts strange, stutters a bit, is married to his job. It's as if he was the inspiration for all the clichés. Do I think it's normal? Not exactly. Do I think Gordon is a bad crew member? No, he's doing great.  ;;;
;But you don't think he's normal.;2;;
2;Henry nods again.*;;;
;What about Sarah Frontz?;3;;
3;I think she's very lucky, she got a job like that while being so young. However, I know she's considered a genius in her field. So it's not exactly surprising. *Henry is quiet for a bit, then he continues.* And also she doesn't work on Saturdays, and keeps giving us ethnic food. She even brought us some cookies. Very tasty. ;;;
;Is she a good crew member?;4;;
4;She is. But that religion of hers makes her a bit odd. No, I don't mean it like that. I believe in God too, I'm Catholic, but... *Henry frowns and grimaces.* Forget it. I'm too suspicious. After all, we all have our quirks. And, with all due respect, so do you, Captain.;;;
;Oh, so that's how it is? I'll keep that in mind. But let's forget about our quirks for a minute and discuss something else. ;-1;;
;That was unexpected. I should go and spend some time alone, thinking about what makes me so weird. Over and out, Liszkiewicz. ;-1;;-1
