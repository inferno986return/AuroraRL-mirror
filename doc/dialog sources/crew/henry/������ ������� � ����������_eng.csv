0;Yeah, I heard your conversation.;
;He says he's seen Aurora 1!;1
;What do you think about that Philosophy of the Path? ;5
;I think he gave some good advice.;6
;Hmm… You know, let's talk about something else.;-1
;Nevermind, I changed my mind. Over and out. ;-1
1;It's possible. *Henry follows it up right away.* What if he hasn't? Even if he really did contact the Aurora 1, we can't just drop what we're doing and go looking for it. We have a different mission, no less important than that one. We'll have to put off looking for it until later.  ;
;Of course. You're right. They'd understand, but still, that's a shame.;2
;I understand. But still, there are people on it.;3
;We can't leave our comrades behind.;4
2;Yes. They'd do the same thing. Do you have anything else? ;
;Yes.;99
;No, nothing. Over and out.;-1
99;I'm listening.;

3;There are people on Earth, too. And there's more of them there than on the Aurora 1. So that's how it is. Did you have anything else, Captain?;
;Yes.;99
;No, nothing. Over and out.;-1
4;We can't. We have to leave them behind. Because there are over seven billion people on Earth. And there's no one apart from us. If we cease to exist, the won't be an Aurora 3. There won't be anyone anymore... *Henry looks at the camera unblinkingly.* I hope you understand. Did you have anything else? ;
;Yes.;99
;No, nothing. Over and out.;-1
5;I can't say anything. It reminds me a bit of Heraclitus, but I can't remember how exactly. It's been too long since I studied Ancient Greek philosophy. ;
;You studied Ancient Greek philosophy?;7
7;Standard officer training course. You didn't know, Captain? *Liszkiewicz smiles.* Did you have anything else?;
;Yes.;99
;No, nothing. Over and out.;-1
6;To pay a visit to the merchant nearby? Yeah, that's true. I'll order our troops to get ready for a call for action. You never know.;
;That sounds reasonable.;8
8;I'm glad you agree with me. Did you have anything else, Captain? ;
;Yes.;99
;No, nothing. Over and out.;-1
