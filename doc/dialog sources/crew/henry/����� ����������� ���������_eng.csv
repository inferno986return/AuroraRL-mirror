0;Not exactly, Captain. They tried to take you prisoner, not kill you. They needed us alive, they wanted to make it to our planet with us.;
;But why?!;1
1;I can't even imagine what they wanted to do next. To infiltrate Earth with our help and capture the human leaders? Or just use us as puppets, do they have the technology to do that? Or maybe something worse... *Henry frowns.* It doesn't matter now. There's probably going to be a long and boring investigation. Or maybe even war.;
;So what do I do now?;2
2;Go to Earth and report what happened, of course. Or maybe you have some other ideas? It's up to you. You're the one in charge. ;
