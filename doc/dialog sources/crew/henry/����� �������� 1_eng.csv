0;I already explained it, Captain. *Liszkiewicz stretches his shoulders as if sitting like that was uncomfortable.* I really don't like thinking back to that. ;marine_dialog_angry;;
;"I've read your dossier, and I've heard a lot about you, too. ""Exceptional heroism"", ""bravery selflessness."" What is there to be ashamed of? ";1;;
;All right, that's all for now.;-1;;
1;"*sigh* Captain, have you been in a war? Actually, let me say that again. *Henry looks at the camera askance, which makes him look more predatory; he asks the next question a bit too deeply.* Have YOU. Been in a war?";;;
;No.;12;;
;Yes. I had to.;13;;
;What does that have to do with it?;2;;
2;Everything. You're trying to understand what you just can't understand. Even if you had said yes or no, you still wouldn't have understood. *Henry runs his hands over his face.* There are wars. There are big wars. And sometimes war is your entire life. And when the end of your life is near, you reflect on the path you've walked and realize a lot of things. *He speaks quietly now.* The mistakes you've made seem even more horrible then. Everything seems even more horrible.;;;
;I… I'm sorry.;4;;
;Got it. I really shouldn't bring it up anymore. ;3;;
;We've all made mistakes, Henry. You don't have to blame yourself.;5;;
3;I'd be very glad if you didn't.;;;
;…;-1;;
4;"Thank you. But that's not what we're talking about. I just don't want to talk about my past. One's private life is priceless. And you have the dossier for everything else. ""You can tell from Henry's demeanor that he doesn't intend talking about this subject any more.* ";;;
;…;-1;;
5;All of us? Yeah... *Henry runs the back of his hand across his forehead.* We've all made mistakes. Everything can be forgiven. I'm Catholic, after all, I should know. Have you made any? I'm talking about serious mistakes made by someone who has power. About those in particular. Take it as you will.;;;
;We're talking about you, not me.;6;;
;Of course I have. Everyone has.;7;;
6;So you haven't. I'm sorry, but how can you understand me, then? *Liszkiewicz shakes his head and taps his finger on the desk.* You know what, let's try to avoid forays into my past and my private life. At least not now. I'm sorry again. *Liszkiewicz's demeanor tells you the conversation is over.*;;;
;Uhm… I… okay. Maybe I really shouldn't have brought it up. Over and out.;-1;;
7;Oh yeah? *Henry smiles very unpleasantly, his face suddenly becomes very nasty.* Have you sent friends to their certain deaths? Have you killed inoccents? Ruined the lives of millions of people? Trained artillery guns on peaceful settlements?;marine_dialog_angry;;
;What…;8;;
8;Nothing, Captain. Nothing at all. It's just that every mistake can be forgiven. But mine can't. *Henry sighs.* Not because someone told me that. Because I realize it myself. *Liszkiewicz's demeanor tells you the conversation is over.* ;;;
;Maybe you're right… Maybe some things really can't be forgiven…;9;;
;I don't know if you're right. But if you carried out someone else's orders, the guilt isn't on you.;10;;
;Your actions helped your country. They helped the world, they helped the majority.;11;;
13;*Henry nods.* I had to, too. Not much, just a little bit. Almost forty years of war. An entire lifetime and a myriad of mistakes that seem even more terrible now, at the end of my life. ;;;
;I… I'm sorry.;4;;
;Got it. I really shouldn't bring it up anymore. ;3;;
;We've all made mistakes, Henry. You don't have to blame yourself.;5;;
12;Then what are we even talking about? Captain, war has been my entire life. Almost forty years, if you can imagine. Think about how many mistakes I've made in those years, and how they seem to me now. *Henry shakes his head, smirks, looks down.* I don't want to talk about it. ;;;
;I… I'm sorry.;4;;
;Got it. I really shouldn't bring it up anymore. ;3;;
;We've all made mistakes, Henry. You don't have to blame yourself.;5;;
9;*Henry shrugs.*;;;
;That's all for now. Over and out.;-1;;-1
10;*Henry smirks and doesn't say anything.*;marine_dialog_happy;;
;Well… if this is how it is, that's all for now. Over and out.;-1;;-1
11;That's right! How could I forget?;;;
;Being a comedian now? All right. Sooner or later you'll understand it, too. I'll leave you to think about it when you have a free minute. Over and out, officer.;-1;;-1
