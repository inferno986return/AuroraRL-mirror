0;*A call from Henry, completely out of nowhere.* Captain? Can you… *he's faltering a little.* Can you talk?;
;Of course.;3
;Why, what is it?;2
;No, sorry. Can we do it later?;1
1;Sure… of course. It's nothing. I'm sorry I interrupted, Captain. *He signs off without letting you answer.*;
;Weird.;-1
2;We need to talk. *He won't say any more.* So are you free right now?;
;Of course.;3
;No, sorry. Can we do it later?;1
3;It's about that movie that we watched in the theater. The war movie.;
;"""The Line?""";4
4;Yeah. Yeah, that's the one... It... That man who... *Henry is gritting his teeth and squinting. Is he nervous?* He wanted the best for everyone. He wanted to save everyone in that city, in Dubai. But he turned out the main villain himself.;
;Yeah, it didn't go very well.;5
5;And in the end, he forgave himself. *Henry is silent.* Do you think it was the right thing to do?;
;What do you mean?;6
6;Umm… I'll ask it in a different way. Could you forgive yourself if you knew that your actions, well-intentioned as they may be, have led and will lead to the deaths of hundreds of people, at the very least? Children? And your intentions really are good.;
;You might get surprised at my answer, but yes. I could.;7
;I don't know, Henry. I can't tell you. I've never been in such situations… although… no, no I haven't.;7
;No. I couldn't.;7
7;*Henry nods, and he doesn't look like he wants to say anything.*;
;So… why are you asking all that?;8
8;I was watching that movie and remembering the wars. The ones I was part of. The conflicts.;
;And…;9
9;It's just... no reason, Captain. At first I was young, then I wasn't. You know, someone once said that war never changes. And some say it actually has changed. I think that's all wrong. War doesn't change, but it changes people. You go through one, and you become a different person. A worse one or a better one? *Henry taps the Bible on his desk and adds:* It's probably the latter. Yeah.;
;It's weird that the movie moved you so much.;10
10;Could be. It's just, you know... that choice in the ending… it would have been great if it were like that in real life. So easy.;
;You took it too seriously.;11
11;Could be. But… still… It just came over me. Nevermind, Captain. It's nothing. I'm just an old man who got the urge to talk. *he signs off*;
;That was weird.;-1
