0;What everyone else does, Captain. I read, I watch movies, I work out… by the way, you should visit our gym. It has a great swimming pool. ;

1;"Not really. Mostly American classics. *Henry reaches under his desk and pulls out - what a surprise! - a paperback book. It's seen better days. You can make out ""Steinbeck. Selected works."" I like Steinbeck. Every word is exactly where it belongs. ";

2;There are many good movies. I like to rewatch The Line. The movie about a squad in Dubai.;
;Tell me more.;4
4;A squad has to get out of the ruined city, but their captain went deeper inside, breaking the order. He had good intentions, but it led to the complete destruction of the city. There's a lot of death, by the end the captain is the only who's still alive. The ending is happy, I like that. The captain is broken, but he managed to go through all that and even stay alive. You have to be very strong to do that. ;marine_dialog_puzzled

3;*Henry smiles politely.* Absolutely not, captain. You, of all people, are in great shape. I've never seen anything like it. Maybe you just have good metabolism. But you can never go to the gym too much. ;marine_dialog_happy
