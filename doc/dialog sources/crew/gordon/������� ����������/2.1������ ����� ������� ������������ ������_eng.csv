0;Captain, we've studied the data you sent over already!;scientist_dialog_happy
;That was quick. What's in it?;1
1;Oh... *He wipes his glasses.* It's hard to say. Physics is a science about spherical cows, you know? It's complicated. We understood that the aliens have their own view on the supersymmetry of space in nature, which produces a logical for their experience mechanism of violating it, and of preventing high quantum corrections via supersymmetry on the electroweak scale... We can't understand that. I mean, we have the data... but arriving to that conclusion is very difficult.;
;Uhhh…;2
2;But they don't know whether dark matter consists of light supersymmetrical particles either!;
;I have a hard time grasping it all logically…;3
3;Who needs logic when you have physics? *Gordon smiles.*;scientist_dialog_happy
;Right. Okay. I'm glad the data was useful to you. Over and out, Gordon.;-1
