1;Yes. Which is why w-we have to k-keep moving. Also, I d-demand a ban on going out to space, and also that you d-don't let anyone come close to the ship. The scanner picked up s-some creatures in the distance. They're b-being aggressive. ;
;Gordon, how do we get out of here?;2
2;We have to s-study the space. I'm sure we will find a way. ;
;I sure hope so. We have some hard work to do. Over and out, Gordon. ;-1
