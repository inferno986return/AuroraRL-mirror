0;*Gordon shuffles nervously.* I told you… it's classified.;;
;But you did tell me something last time.;1;
1;*He nods cautiously in response.*;;
;Which means you can tell me something, after all. I have to know what you did before, don't I? ;2;
2;I said… Worlds with different physical conditions. You called them parallel worlds, but it's not true! They aren't like that! They aren't related to our dimension in any way, they're completely different! ;;
;Tell about the experiment itself in more detail.;5;
;Like the one we were in THAT time? I mean, ahem… you remember. ;3;inside.completed
3;Yes! Yes! That world isn't parallel to ours, that isn't even a real term. It's just, sometimes they get weaker... *Gordon tries to explain something to you using his hands.* You won't understand... some bonds get weaker, and you can invade those worlds! The objective of the experiment I took part in was researching the effects that those worlds had on different objects from our world. ;;
;Did you know about the world we've been in?;4;
4;*Gordon shakes his head no.*;;
;Tell about the experiment itself in more detail.;5;
5;Three ph-phases. And our boss, Gabe…;;
;Tell me about the first phase.;6;
;Tell me about the second phase.;7;
;Tell me about the third phase.;8;
;Gabe?;9;
;Hm. And that's all you can tell me right now?;10;
;I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.;-1;
6;Phase one of the experiment. The effects of foreign-world physical conditions on inanimate objects. We didn't receive any results that could be applied practically, so Gabe authorized proceeding to phase two. ;;
;Tell me about the second phase.;7;
;Tell me about the third phase.;8;
;Gabe?;9;
;Hm. And that's all you can tell me right now?;10;
;I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.;-1;
7;Phase two. The effects of foreign-world physical conditions on different kinds of animals. It was a great breakthrough for some medical technologies, such as, uhm... implanting, mostly, and classic cloning. Resetting the cell division counter.;;
;Tell me about the first phase.;6;
;Tell me about the third phase.;8;
;Gabe?;9;
;Hm. And that's all you can tell me right now?;10;
;I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.;-1;
8;Phase three. Gabe went off the radar and the experiment was closed. It became completely classified. The third phase meant subjecting a human being to the physical environment of a different world. It would have been... *Gordon sighs musingly* wonderful. ;;
;Tell me about the first phase.;6;
;Tell me about the second phase.;7;
;Gabe?;9;
;Hm. And that's all you can tell me right now?;10;
;I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.;-1;
9;He was… Old school. A true scientist, very determined and smart. I r-r-respect him a lot. He probably works in complete secrecy now. And the third phase will have gone through by now. Without me. ;;
;Tell me about the first phase.;6;
;Tell me about the second phase.;7;
;Tell me about the third phase.;8;
;Hm. And that's all you can tell me right now?;10;
;I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.;-1;
10;That is c-c-classified information. I… just can't tell you anymore. ;;
;Tell me about the first phase.;6;
;Tell me about the second phase.;7;
;Tell me about the third phase.;8;
;Gabe?;9;
;I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.;-1;
