0;Do you want to discuss something else?;;;;
;I think we should start with the alien contact.;2;;;
;I believe we've found a raw-material appendage planet.;8;;;
;There's an urgent information about the Aurora-1.;21;;;
;Nothing special. I've told them to send all the information to the Analysis Cell. So, you'll have the professional report in a few minutes.;31;;;
2;I'm all ears. *Kilmovi tries to show his attention, and he really listens*;;;;
;Well. We've met other species' representatives. There were five of them. Maybe more, that didn't play a major role anyway.;3;;;
3;*Kilmovi listens silently*;;;;
;Klisks, borks, zorsans, rogues and gardeners. They are all way too closed, I can't tell you something certain about them. You'll see a normal report later.;4;;;
4;Good. What's their attitude towards each other? How did they react to your expedition?;;;;
;Beside some local incidents, there are no conflicts. Even though they are so reserved, their reaction was normal.;5;;;
5;Be more specific, commander.;;;;
;I can't tell more. Maybe, it's just my impression because they are so different. Maybe, I am right and it's really strange. I included the description of this fact in my report.;6;;;
6;*Kilmovi wrinkles* Listen. We've known each other for years and we know what common reports are like. Let's do it like in the great days of old, briefly and in a few words.;;;;
;Martan, they seem to be illogical. Even klisks are depending on the Trade Codex, though they have a reputation of great dealers and diplomats. I don't know for sure, what is that Codex. You can name this thing the Codex, the Bible, the Koran, I don't care, but sounds really strange. Taking into account the level of their development, it is just illogical.;7;;;
7;Okay. I'll visit the analysts when I have time. I believe you've brought enough information for analyzing. So far, so good. Anything else?;;;;
;As for the resourse extraction on other planets, we've found a nice place.;8;;;
;There's an urgent information about the Aurora-1.;21;;;
;There is nothing more. Analysts have the information, you'd better read the report.;31;;;
8;Brilliant. I'm listening.;;;;
;Well… don't get your hopes too high. We just have their coordinates, we haven't checked them yet.;9;colony_search.found;;
;The planet is fantastic, to be honest. It has oxygen atmosphere and comfort temperature. Its position isn't so far away even for our spaceships. You can get caustobiolith with your bare hands. And there are a lof of black gold, also.;11;colony_search.explored;;
;The planet is not bad, it is similar to Earth, but its mineral potential is much higher. A perfect place for a colony. Though, it has its drawbacks. We've explored this babe throughout, and as for the other side of the coin…;13;colony_search.explored_fully;;
9;Wait, did the solar wind blew your brain out? Or do you have bags of time?! Good job! Fine! Well done! Damn it... Well, okay. When you start your second flight, your main goal is going to be the exploration of that planet.;;;;
;Sorry for that, Martan. I just ran out of time.;10;;;
10;You have to make it. Anything else?;;;;
;Concerning the alien contrat.;2;;;
;Some things about the Aurora-1.;21;;;
;Nothing left, but idle talk. I've sent the information to the Analysis Cell, so you'll have the report soon.;31;;;
11;Drawbacks?;;;;
;Animals there are aggressive. Nothing serious, just give the colonists popguns. They will handle this problem.;12;;;
12;That's not so bad. If it is as good as you say, then we have one trouble less. Do you have something else?;;;;
;A little something about the aliens.;2;;;
;An important information that can help us to find the Aurora-1.;21;;;
;Essentially, that's it. Nothing to it.;31;;;
13;Well, well?;;;;
;We've explored some of the representatives of their fauna. Bad news. There are strong and dangerous creatures. Even if you are armed to teeth, it'll be difficult. I've sent the additional data to the Analysis Cell.;14;;;
14;Oh, Jesus. Troubles with colonization - that's what we need in this hard times! Do you think it is worth it?;;;;
;You know me, it is well worth it! There probably will be some victims, but, you know, it is a lot at stake. One needs to be dedicated.;15;;;
;Eh, no, Martan, you've know me for years, why do you ask? We have a riddle here. Aggressive fauna versus an ocean of resourses. Do we need to face the risks and try to organize a colony there? I don't know. I have no respond.;17;;;
;You've know me for years, and my answer won't surprise you. No. This planet is not worth all these victims. We'll definitely find another planet.;19;;;
15;That's the way you are. What a passion, what a passion. *Kilmovi squares and opens his fists*;;;;
;What's up?;16;;;
16;Well, your enthusiasm is appreciated, though I don't think we need to give people's lives in exchange for resourses. You're right, for sure, but... We don't need to be so careless. Blood is thicker than water. What else do we have?;;;;
;Some things about the aliens.;2;;;
;An important information that can help us to find the Aurora-1.;21;;;
;Essentially, that's it. Nothing to it.;31;;;
17;I expected as much, that's the way you are. Your position is quiet right: think beforehand, do afterwards. But here I didn't want to hear a solution, just an advice.;;;;
;Sorry, but I do think so.;18;;;
18;Nevermind, it's ok. You are an important person here, so we want you to be more determined and tell us your opinion. But I understand one thing: we don't need to give it the bum's rush. What else?;;;;
;Some words about the aliens.;2;;;
;An important information that can help us to find the Aurora-1.;21;;;
;Essentially, that's it. Nothing to it.;31;;;
19;As expected, like the psychological characteristic. I've know you for years I'm not surprised. Your position is quiet right, we mustn't sacrifice. But you're way too one-sided.;;;;
;Is that bad?;20;;;
20;Nope. It's just naive. Under these circumstances you have to understand that there will be victims. For sure. It is inevitable. I got your point. We need to be extra careful. That's it. Anything else?;;;;
;Some words about the aliens.;2;;;
;An important information that can help us to find the Aurora-1.;21;;;
;Essentially, that's it. Nothing to it.;31;;;
21;What? The Aurora-1? Wow, I'm surprised. That is really important. *Kilmovi takes a red phone without a keyboard from the table*;;;;
;Wait! Nothing serious yet, and also… It seems to be a rumour.;22;;;
22;You said it is an important information. Okay. *Kilmovi takes his hand off the phone, but leaves the phone on the table.;;;;
;So, according to the information I have, the Aurora-1 and its crew are okay. It means they are alive and in good health.;23;;;
23;Is that all? Uhh. So, where are they?;;;;
;Nobody knows.;24;;;
24;Oh… Well. Who gave you this information?;;;;
;A very strange alien. Gardener. He refused to give more details and told me that it wasn't my path and I didn't need to follow the Aurora-1.;25;;;
25;"Well. ""The path"". What's the path? I guess it is more than just a phrase. ";;;;
;Don't know if it is just a phrase or there is something more behind it. Maybe I didn’t get the point and he meant something completely different.;26;;;
;"Sure, you're right. These gardeners follow the philosophy of path. I can't tell its main point but one of my new alien-friends described it like ""Everything flows, everything changes"".";27;klisk.knows_about_path_philosophy;;klisk.philosophy_research
26;We need to find it out. Though, probably, he lied... I see no reason for it, but, anyway. If there is an opportunity to find the Aurora-1, you need to do it. Just don't forget about other tasks. Anything else?;;;;
;Some words about the aliens.;2;;;
;It's time to talk about the colonization.;8;;;
;No, that's all I wanted to say. You know, we have more important things to do now.;31;;;
27;"""Everything flows, everything changes"" you say? *Kilmovi looks at a monitor and types* Yeah, right. I am familiar with this phrase, you can find it in a historical encyclopaedia. It's the history of the ancient Greece. Do I need to continue?";;;;
;Just send it to analysts and we'll start doing our work.;28;;;
;Of course. It can turn out to be a very helpful information.;29;;;
28;As you wish. But it would be nice if you look in the encyclopaedia when you have time. ;;;;
;I would like to discuss an alien question.;2;;;
;I have some information about a good place for a colonization.;8;;;
;That's it, no need in idle talk.;31;;;
29;"Well...  Heraclitus. A historian of the Ancient Greece. A presocratiñ. Funny, he was interested in space and explored it. Of course, ""explored"" in his own philosophical way, though it is still interesting. The full version of the phrase you've said is ""Everything flows, everything changes and nothing stands still"". Hm...";;;;
;And nothing stands still… Rather humorless.;30;;;
30;Yeah, but you can understand it in different ways. Pity, I don't have enough time to analyse it more properly... Anyway, I'll send it to analysts. And copies to the Aurora-2, check your computer when you are free.  Anything else?;;;;
;Some words about the aliens. ;2;;;
;It's time to talk about the colonization.;8;;;
;That's it, no need in idle talk.;31;;;
31;Wait! Do you have time for a conversation with an old friend?;;;;
;Martan, excuse me, time presses.;32;;;
;"Sure. And if there is ""a conversation with an old friend"", you'd better get your wife's cookies. Don't know yet if I miss you or the cookies of your wife more.";33;;;
32;*Martan shakes his head* What a pity. Sure, it's a small stuff, but I just wanted to talk about this and that... Okay. Hope, you'll pay me a visit before your next flight.;;;;
;I can't promise anything. I have to go.;-1;;;
33;*literally in ten minutes Martan cleans up the table and it magically transforms. Now there are an old electric kettle and a small dish with homemade cookies. In addition, he gives you a cunning smile and puts a small bottle of rum on the table*;;;;
;Wow. Coffee with rum? As usual. I'd like to have more rum and less coffee, hehe.;34;;;
;Martan, just a few drops. You know I'm not a big fan.;39;;;
;Oh, no-no-no. If I die, I don't want to die with both alcoholism and obesity. You know me, I don't drink at all.;44;;;
34;*he pours out. A few minutes of eating and drinking, then he says* So, tell me, do you like it? Deep space, a giant spaceship, a lot of people under your control... ;;;;
;Hah. Well, you know, in the beginning it was a little bit frightful. When I got used, and it was ok. It happened fast. Very fast, you know me. Explore. Adapt. Do it! And then win.;35;;;
;It was an excellent opportunity to approve myself. In addition, I wouldn't say that the relationship on the Aurora-2 is too different from the Earth's ones. It's the same but entourage is different. I think it won't be a problem for me to work more productively.;40;;;
;It wasn't simple. Though, I think, it is always so in the beginning, and you need to understand that the Aurora is what it is. Sure, deep space, aliens, a lot of people under my control... It is a great responsibility for me. You know, I wasn't good. But next time I'll do my best, everything is at stake.;45;;;
35;Hah. Self-confident and hot-blooded - as always. Fine. As for the aliens… Tell me, what do they look like? Are they like fantasy authors showed us?;;;;
;I don't know about the fantasy authors, Martan, but as for me, they are strangers now and they will remain the same, I think. No, I'm not a racist or xenophobe - I just have other things to do. Maybe if everything goes good, somebody will make friends with them somewhere and somehow... I have another things to do.;36;;;
;Haven't thought about that. Maybe, it's a sign that they turned out to be very ordinary, though strange. Yeah, strange. They are different from us, but in the same time they are similar to us, though they don't look the same. That's my answer.;41;;;
;Martan, they are different. Really, you look at them and talk to them, then you find out that they are completely different, so unknown for humanity. I don't know how exactly the contact with them will help us, but it will. Certainly. Even if we didn't have the crisis, it would help our development.;46;;;
36;This post needs such a person, friend. A professional, a master. You know, I look at you and I feel safe. Even if you fail, you will do your best.;;;;
;Of course, I will. Why do you say such things?;37;;;
37;Just because. Yesterday I came home and saw Ntanda and my son watching a documentary movie. About you. I mean, about the Aurora, but mainly about you. That's why I thought about that. Finally, you are a very good friend for me and Ntanda, we worry about you.;;;;
;Come on, man. I haven't noticed such sentimentality before, my friend. But it is nice to see that you care. Hah! Sadly, I have to go. Good luck to you.;38;;;
38;Keep it. You need it more.;;;;
;Yeah, that's right.;-1;;;
39;Sure, just for a flavour. *he holds his thumb on the bottleneck and adds less than five drops to your cup. You drink silently for a half an hour* Now tell me. Do you like it? I mean deep space, a giant spaceship, a lot of people under your control…;;;;
;Hah. Well, you know, in the beginning it was a little bit frightful. After I got used, and it was ok. It happened fast. Very fast, you know me. Explore. Adapt. Do it! And then win.;35;;;
;It was an excellent opportunity to approve myself. In addition, I wouldn't say that the relationship on the Aurora-2 is too different from the Earth's ones. It's the same but entourage is different. I think it won't be a problem for me to work more productively.;40;;;

It is a great responsibility for me. You know, I wasn't good. But next time I'll do my best, everything is at stake.;45;;;
40;You are cold, my boy. But that's the way you are. A mixture of professionality and emotions. Listen. Tell me about aliens. How do they look?;;;;
;I don't know about the fantasy authors, Martan, but as for me, they are strangers now and they will remain the same, I think. No, I'm not a racist or xenophobe - I just have other things to do. Maybe if everything goes good, somebody will make friends with them somewhere and somehow... I have another things to do. ;36;;;

;Martan, they are different. Really, you look at them and talk to them, then you find out that they are completely different, so unknown for humanity. I don't know how exactly the contact with them will help us, but it will. Certainly. Even if we didn't have the crisis, it would help our development.;46;;;
41;Yeah, I've never doubted you. You are the best candidature for this post. Fortunately, we haven't chosen a weak-minded war dog for this post. An all-rounder has much more opportunities to save us.;;;;
;You are saying strange things. Are you drunk already?;42;;;
42;Ha-ha-ha. Nice joke. No. I've been thinking about it for some days already. Not just about you, but about the Aurora-2, about the crew... Ntanda and me - we're on pins and needles. You are a friend of us, you know.;;;;
;I'm glad you think so. You're special to me. Martan, I have to go now. I wish I can stay, but time moves on.;43;;;
43;Sure, keep on working. And good luck to you.;;;;
;You too. Say hello to Ntanda and your son.;-1;;;
44;Of course you don't drink. Just a propine. *Kilmovi pours some rum into a cup and then adds boiling coffee with sugar. You have just a cup of coffee. For a couple of minutes you are eating up the pasrty and drinking two cups of coffee. In this way you can easily pun on weight* Ohh, overate a little bit. Tell me everything. What do you think about all of that? Deep space, a giant spaceship, a lot of people under your control...;;;;
;Hah. Well, you know, in the beginning it was a little bit frightful. After I got used, and it was ok. It happened fast. Very fast, you know me. Explore. Adapt. Do it! And then win.;35;;;
;It was an excellent opportunity to approve myself. In addition, I wouldn't say that the relationship on the Aurora-2 is too different from the Earth's ones. It's the same but entourage is different. I think it won't be a problem for me to work more productively.;40;;;

It is a great responsibility for me. You know, I wasn't good. But next time I'll do my best, everything is at stake.;45;;;
45;Oh, as usual, I expected as much. You are as sensitive as usual. Okay, as for the aliens... What do they look like? Are they like fantasy authors showed us? ;;;;
;I don't know about the fantasy authors, Martan, but as for me, they are strangers now and they will remain the same, I think. No, I'm not a racist or xenophobe - I just have other things to do.

I don't know how exactly the contact with them will help us, but it will. Certainly. Even if we didn't have the crisis, it would help our development.;46;;;
46;Well… Yeah, fortunately, you have this post. You're more of a romantic than of a militarist. It may sound odd, but if you can't, nobody can.;;;;
;Oh, come on, Martan… Why are you saying so? ;47;;;
47;Just because. Ntanda and my son - they've been asking about you. They do worry, me too. In the end, you may be a hero, but you are still our friend.;;;;
;Oh, Martan, I'm touched.  It's a satisfaction to know that you care. But you don't have to. Unfortunately, I have to go now.;48;;;
48;Oh, yes. Sure. Sorry for taking your time, just wanted to chat a little. Hope, in future we'll have a lot of conversations like this.;;;;
;I do hope as well. I have to go.;-1;;;
