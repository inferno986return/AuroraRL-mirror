0;*Your immediate superior, Martan Kilmovi, is looking straight at you. Maybe he missed you. Or maybe not. It is really hard to tell. You can see tiredness in his eyes. His shirt and waistcoat have a scent of a typical men’s cologne* I’m glad to see you, commander. Report.;;Yes, sir! To be straight with you, I have a lot of things to report about. This conversation will take several hours.;11;*he shakes his head* That’s too bad. There are a lot of journalists outside. If they don’t get you, they will simply take us by storm.;;Martan… Sir, I have a few questions about this. What should I say? What mustn't I say?;22;*Kilmovi shakes his head* Well, that depends on obtained results. I can tell you precisely that you mustn’t tell them about the Aurora-1. As for the other things… damn it. You're the hero of Earth, is there anything I can say that might help you with all those questions? I doubt it.;;Too bad. It seems, it won’t be an easy task.;33;We'll see. It's time to go. Good luck. And one more thing, you still have your place at the table.;;Does your wife still bring her cookies here?;44;*he laughs* Sure thing! Some things will never change.;;At least, something good.;-1
