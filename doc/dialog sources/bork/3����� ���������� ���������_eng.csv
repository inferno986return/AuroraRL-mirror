0;*The Bork Embassy is obviously built according to mixed standards: there are only four floors, but the building is huge. Your transport makes it past two rings of security (apparently, the guards are watching local porn and playing video games fervently) and stops next to the entrance* There we are.;;;
;Thanks for the lift.;1;;
1;*The driver doesn't answer. The transport drives off. The same Bork who was at the spaceport greets you.*;;;
;Heh, that was quick.;2;;
;How come you're here? We hurried here straight away.;11;!bork.city_view;
2;You just have to know the best routes. *The Bork looks extremely pleased with himself* From the looks of it, you decided to look around Shorter after all. How did you like our capital? Did you see anything interesting on the way? ;;;
;Shorter. Is that what the city is called?;3;;
;It's a beautiful city. Why are there so few tall buildings?;4;;
;We saw a fight, and the local law enforcer just stood there and didn't do anything. Why? ;5;;
;We saw the obelisk honoring your victory over the Zorsan.;7;;
;Maybe we should get to business already.;10;;
3;Shorter, yeah. But you can call it Sorter, too. Us borks are used to pronouncing the S as sh. A peculiarity of our vocal apparatus, it's easier for us that way. ;;;
;It's a beautiful city. Why are there so few tall buildings?;4;;
;We saw a fight, and the local law enforcer just stood there and didn't do anything. Why? ;5;;
;We saw the obelisk honoring your victory over the Zorsan.;7;;
;Maybe we should get to business already.;10;;
4;It's a relatively new city. Old Shorter was destroyed. So we're rebuilding it, there are no tall buildings yet. ;;;
;Shorter. Is that what the city is called?;3;;
;We saw a fight, and the local law enforcer just stood there and didn't do anything. Why? ;5;;
;Obviously, it has to do with the obelisk we saw? The one honoring your victory over the Zorsan. ;7;;
;Maybe we should get to business already.;10;;
5;Oh... That has to do with our culture. As you may have noticed, the Borks are a pretty agressive people. And most of them aren't too bright, either. So these things happen *The Bork shrugs, and the very human gesture makes him look rather ridiculous.*;;;
;Actually, they had knives. But your cop only got involved when one of the fighter lost consciousness.;6;;
6;A cop?.. Hm. I understand what you're trying to say. Yes. What can you do? Borks are sturdy creatures.Trying to punch each other's lights out with our fists really won't work. So no one really gives us any mind if the fight involves makeshift weapons. Until it becomes a murder.;;;
;Shorter. Is that what the city is called?;3;;
;It's a beautiful city. Why are there so few tall buildings?;4;;
;We saw the obelisk honoring your victory over the Zorsan.;7;;
;Maybe we should get to business already.;10;;
7;Obelisk? Victory? Did the driver tell you all that? *The Bork laughs. More accurately, he lets out a dull roar, blinks and pats his sides, but the essence of these actions could be logically explained as laughter.* He lied to you. ;;;
;…;8;;
8;*The Bork finishes laughing and continues.* At one time, we were at war with the Zorsan. Thirty years ago. They occupied Shipshiar and landed their troops here. They took most of the city. Then we kicked them out and destroyed them. They used WMD's, the city was no more. *Bork talks about in an everyday lazy voice. Even taking his alien way of showing emotions into account, it is obvious that he doesn't feel sorry about it at all.*;;;
;You're talking about it like… As if it were nothing. ;9;;
9;Well, what can you do. We don't like death, but we don't mourn for long either.;;;
;Shorter. Is that what the city is called?;3;;
;It's a beautiful city. Why are there so few tall buildings?;4;;
;We saw a fight, and the local law enforcer just stood there and didn't do anything. Why? ;5;;
;Maybe we should get to business already.;10;;
11;*The Bork looks very salf-satisfied.* Consider it a family secret. *Then he sighs.* Too bad you didn't take the opportunity to see the city. It's considered beautiful.;;;
;What can you do? Business first, leisure later.;10;;
10;Right. Business. Follow me, please. *He entres the building.* ;;;
;…;12;;
12;*The interior can be caled simple. Everything looks rich, but rough,from soft sofas to the chandeliers. But it doesn't offend the eye: the designer had taste.* ;;;
;…;13;;
13;*After some time the escort stops next to a small metal door, behind which you can hear music, Borks roaring and Klisks clicking.* Our canteen is there. Let your people rest there, you will be talking with Mr Diplomatic Representative one-on-one, anyway.;;;
;Is that really necessary?;14;;
14;Pardon me, are you afraid? *The Bork roars tauntingly*;;;
;I'm not pardonning you, and I'm not. I'm cautious.;15;;
;I'm not afraid. Guys, stay here.;16;!henry.taken;
;I'm not afraid. Guys, stay here. Henry, follow me. You can wait on the couch outside the office.;16;henry.taken;
15;What can you do? We aren't allowed to invite so many people into Mr Diplomatic Representative's waiting room. *He taunts you again.* ;;;
;All right, I get it. Guys, have fun. And use condoms, should anything happen. ;16;!henry.taken;
;All right. But I'm taking my second-in-command with me. Worst case scenario, he waits on the couch outside. ;16;henry.taken;
16;*Then you walk down corridors full of carved wood decorations. The atmosphere here is mellow and completely un-Borkish. You turn left, then a couple times more, and then you're standing in front of yet another door. Unlike the one before it, it's wooden and unmarked. There is a couch on each side of it. A typical Bork is in one of them, looking irritated and menacing. The holster on his hip makes him look even more impressive. Your escort shrugs.* Oh. As you can see, the Diplomatic Representative is busy. Don't worry, as soon as he's finished, you are coming in, ahead of the line. I'll call you. *The escort goes inside the door.* ;;;
;Henry, let's sit down on the other couch.;17;henry.taken;
;*Sit down on the other couch*;17;;
17;*The bork keeps silent for a couple more minutes, breathing with concentration and making sense of what he just saw. Then he turns his head lazily.* What? Ahead of the line? You? ;;;
;Well, that's what he said. So yeah, me.;18;;
;I don't know. He said so, but… he says a lot of things. And thinks a lot of things. You go first, if you want. I don't care. ;27;;
;*Keep silent*;33;;
18;*The Bork flinches.* I sit here an hour, two, three! And you go first?!;;;
;Look, it's not my fault. This is how it is. I'm on an important assignment.;19;;
19;Me too! Very important! *The Bork wheezes loudly and gets up from the sofa.* ;;;
;Okay. If you're getting up to do what I think you want to do, you better sit back down. ;21;;
21;What?! Smartass! You calling me dumb?!;;;
;…;22;;
22;*Having gotten up from the sofa, the Bork keeps raging and waving his hands around, and the tone of his voice keeps rising. He paces back and forth and speaks, not very intelligibly, but fiercely.* There! You sit here, and then these people come! And call me stupid! ;;;
;Shut up and sit back down!;26;;
;Henry, what are you going to say now?;23;henry.taken;
23;Captain, I understand Borks pretty well… He's acting a bit… stupid. As if he's trying to provoke a conflict. ;marine_dialog;;
;What do you mean?;24;;
24;If a Bork wants to attack you, he punches you in the mug, no foreplay. If he doesn't want to, he doesn't. And he just… *he shrugs meaningfully.* ;marine_dialog;;
;And do you propose we do?;25;;
25;Keep alert and don't give in to provocations. But should anything happen, don't hesitate to act. *Meanwhile, the Bork keeps getting angrier.*;marine_dialog;;
;All right, let me try for the last time. Listen! Enough. Let's talk. ;26;;
26;*The Bork doesn't listen to you. He roars and charges you, stamping his feet loudly. You can't see anything in his stupid eyes. Danger. No time to ask for help. Time to act.* ;;;
;*Kill the Bork*;38;;
;*Wound the Bork*;40;;
;*Dodge the blow*;42;;
27;*The Bork looks at you as if his his brains just got overloaded.* Wha-? ;;;
;I don't know who's going first. Let's wait for him and see. You want to go first? If it's so important, I'm okay with it. ;28;;
28;*The Bork gets up.* Hey! Don't you act like I'm stupid!;;;
;Stupid? Why? I never said anything like that.;29;;
29;Don't try to fool me!;;;
;…;30;;
30;*The Bork gets angry, begins to wave his hands around and grabs his holster. The situation in the waiting room becomes dangerous. The escort still isn't there.* ;;;
;I'm sorry if something's the matter. Again, if you want to go first, go. What do I care? ;33;;
;Henry, it's time for your priceless advice.;31;henry.taken;
31;I appreciate the sarcasm, Captain. Back to the subject at hand, it's weird. It's like he's trying to provoke you and himself on purpose. ;marine_dialog;;
;That's pretty obvious. What else?;32;;
32;Borks aren't usually like that. I don't like this. I'm confused. I only know one thing: if something happens, you have to act decisively and without hesitation. *The Bork is still making a ruckus. The escort still isn't there.* ;marine_dialog;;
;All right. I'll try this for the last time. Hey, buddy, sorry if I offended you. If you want to go first, go first, I don't care. ;26;;
33;*The Bork speaks more loudly.* Hey! I asked you a question! You, go first?!;;;
;*Keep silent, trying not to pay him any attention*;34;;
34;*The Bork jumps to his feet. The floor creaks audibly.* What, you think I'm dumb?! I asked you a question! Answer it!;;;
;*Keep silent*;26;;
;I don't want any trouble. Calm down.;35;;
35;What?! You don't wa- *The Bork breathes loudly and shakes his head.* ;;;
;I don't want any trouble. Let's just talk. Calm down, please. ;26;;
;Henry, we have to do something about him.;36;henry.taken;
36;*Henry narrows his eyes.* Captain, he's riling himself up. He's trying to make you mad, and himself, too. Try to calm him down. ;marine_dialog;;
;What if I can't?;37;;
37;I don't know. But you have to do something fast. *The Bork looks angrier by the second.* ;marine_dialog;;
;Okay, well… Please, don't be angry. We don't know your customs, so we could have offended you somehow. ;26;;
38;*You hear a loud bang, as if from a cannon, and the flash makes you tear up and shut your eyes. Without opening them, you smell gunpowder and some foul smell. Opening your eyes, you understand that it's Bork blood and scrambled brains. You killed the attacker.*;;;
;…;39;;
39;*The escort rushes out the door almost immediately. Your explanation is corroborated by a video recording. Despite what just happened, after some time you are still allowed to talk to the Diplomatic Representative.*;;;
;…;-1;;1
40;*You hear a loud bang, as if from a cannon, and the flash makes you tear up and shut your eyes. Without opening them, you smell gunpowder and some foul smell.  Although... no. The first thing to reach your conscience is the roar of the Bork lying down and clutching his bloodied leg, even louder than the shot. Only your excellent marksmanship has saved you from doing a whole lot of damage.* ;;;
;…;41;;
41;*The escort jumps out like a jack out of the box. The wounded Bork is driven away. Your explanation of what just happened is fully supported by the video surveillance feed. Asking you to forgive that misunderstanding, the escort sends you off to see the Diplomatic Representative.* ;;;
;…;-1;;2
42;*Your training is good. You dodge away, and the clumsy Bork smashes straight into a wall with a mighty rumble. The next fifteen seconds transform the room into a playground for a game of cat-and-mouse: the Bork chases you, and you dodge him. You are interrupted by a wild, incredibly loud roar of the escort who finally got back. Obviously, it is laughter.*;;;
;…;43;;
43;*The angry as hell troublemaker is walked out. The escort, having had his good laugh, lets you in to see the Diplomatic Representative.* ;;;
;…;-1;;3
