0;*on a video screen you see a creature. You can't understand its emotions, though it doesn't seem to be agressive* You... Who are you? ;;;;
;We're from Earth, we're representatives of the human race. This is our first contact with your race.;1;;;
1;Good. *the creature clicks wierdly* Klisks. We are klisks.;;;;
;It's nice to see another soul friend. Can you tell us about your race?;5;!gardeners.first_contact;;
;It's nice to see another soul friend. You are the second ones we've met - we were found by gardeners about a week ago.;2;gardeners.first_contact;;
2;*the klisk twitches. At least, it looked alike* Ts-ts-ts-ts! *The klisk clicks like an animal* Have they sold you the information? Have they? What kind of information?;;;;
;No, we didn't have any deals. We had a strange conversation... Gardeners told us to contact you, they said it'd make the connection with other civilizations easier.;3;;;
3;Kinda strange. Gardeners made a deal with us... But they didn't do it with you.;;;;
;What deal?;4;;;
4;Doesn•t matter. *clicks again* They were right. If you want to connect other races, you go to klisks. Klisks are the best dealers in the whole Cluster.;;;;
;Klisks?.. Tell me about your race.;5;;;
;What are you selling?;6;;;
;As for the deal. Why isn't it important? What kind of deal did you make?;7;;;
;Yes, we want to know something about other civilizations and connect them. Also to establish contacts, conclude an agreement about the mutual military collaboration and so on.;8;;;
5;Klisks. Believe me, the translation of the word will explain nothing. My nation has been living and trading since the beginning of time, the Trading Codex leads us. ;;;;
;The Trading Codex?;9;;;
9;Yes. There we can find knowledge about the right value of all and about the beneficial exchange. Klisks follow the Codex, and it shows Klisks the way to peace and prosperity.;;;;
;W-w-wait‰ So, the Trading Codex‰ ehm‰ is it your religion? ;10;;;
10;No! *the klisk clicks again, but now clicks are more frequent* Klisks left it behind. The Trading Codex is something different. As I said before, there is knowledge about the right value of all and about the beneficial exchange.;;;;
;Fine, not a religion, but a phylisophy of life. Anyway, it seems to be strange.;11;;;
11;You're not a klisk. You can't understand it.;;;;
;You're in a better position to judge.;4;;;
6;Anything that can bring profit.;;;;
;Hm‰ Useful minerals? Planets? Everything is a pretty loose concept. ;12;;;
12;*slow and drawling clicks. Seems like a laughter.* No, we trade everything, but such useless things. Maybe it will surprise you, but Cluster is infinite. It extends every second. Everybody will be satisfied with planets and resources. It would be a foolish thing to trade.;;;;
;So, even here the big bang theory is popular. Good. Anyway, what are you selling? ;13;;;
13;The most valuable thing is knowledge, information. Cluster is infinite and undiscovered. Klisks, and borks, and zorsans, and even rogues want to know about everything around them. The more dateiled information is, the higher its price. You'll have almost nothing for a new system's map, but you'll have a lot for a full scan of all planets and collecting their genetical, geological examples.;;;;
;Well‰ And what, is it only the information? What else do you sell? Don't even know‰ maybe, some kind of repair details? Medical supplies?;14;;;
;Borks? Zorsans? Rogues?;15;;;
14;*clicks again, seems like a laughter* You're funny. Sure, we have everything travellers might ever need. I thought you meant something unusual.;;;;
;Sorry, it is all new for me. So, you trade information. Is it the only thing you sell? ;16;;;
16;There are more‰ Some unusual things. They aren't similar to each other. It might be traces of some lost civilizations. Or maybe it's some rare resources. We don't really know. All worthful things will find their buyers. ;;;;
;Good. Who are borks? Zorsans? Rogues?;15;;;
15;An information costs credits... Anyway, the general information is free. You are talking about the second type race. Borks. They are aggressive and dumb, yet not all of them. If somebody attacks without any obvious reason, it is a bork. ;;;;
;Oh. And what can you say about zorsans and rogues?;17;;;
17;"Rogues. Years ago they had their own planet, but they left it - I don't know the details, but it was far-far away, ages ago. Nowadays their motherland is a conglomerate of giant motherships. Earlier rogues provided us with all information we needed, 'cause they are space nomads and they constantly explore it. However... recently *he says a word, an interpreter explains it like ""fifty years ago""* they have reduced their activity. It's bad for us.";;;;
;Interesting. So unsual... And what about zorsans? Or zorsan? ;18;;;
18;Nothing. Zorsans are young. They think they are an empire, and they're aggressive. They're like borks, but a bit mor civilized. They haven't understood yet that there is there is a place for everybody in Cluster... They will understand it. Eventually. ;;;;
;Do races divide into types? You meantioned that borks are a second type. What did you mean? ;19;;;
;What kind of a transaction with gardeners did you talk about? They are strange creatures. The only thing I want is to understand them better. ;7;;;
;Okay. But now let's talk about information. You know, my nation has only recently mastered the technology of interstellar travelling. I was instructed to establish a diplomatic contact with every developed civilizations I meet. ;8;;;
19;There are five types of races. They're divided by several factors: biological, physcological, behavioural...  It's not really important. An important point is that different types of races are really very different. A second type race can't come in contact with a third type race - due to some physical reasons and mutual misunderstanding. Klisks can establish  such contact. And it comes at a price, a very high price.;;;;
;What kind of a transaction with gardeners did you talk about? They are strange creatures. The only thing I want is to understand them better.;7;;;
;Well, we're not interested in this aspect right now. I would like to connect other nations.;8;;;
7;*fast clicks, unregulated rhythm. Seemingly, he is anxious*;;;;
;Is something wrong? Is it a private information? ;20;;;
20;No. We've just figured something out about gardeners.;;;;
;What's that?;21;;;
21;The information costs credits. Codex doesn't allow to give information for free. As for this new information, it is forbidden to share even for credits. For now.;;;;
;Codex? What codex?;22;;;
;I got your point. In such case, I have a question for you. I was told to get in touch with the nearest developed civilizations. I think, your help would be very useful.;8;;;
22;He leads us.;;;;
;Leads you? You mean, laws or principles? ;9;;;
8;*fast rhytmic clicks* Ts-ts-ts-ts. A bargain, bargain. It is good.;;;;
;‰;23;;;
23;Codex says about a deal, but a deal might not happen... If you need the coordinates of capital planets, you can get them for free. Godwill gesture. *clicks are hasty, gradually slowing down* Furthermore, I'll provide you with information, that will not only help you to establish a diplomatic contact, but also will give an opportunity to gain a benefit for your civilization. That is the deal. You will have to pay. ;;;;
;What•s the price?;24;;;
24;You may pay with credits: seven credits for information about any race, even Klisks. But I guess, you have no money for that. If I'm right, we can exchange information about your civilization for our information about any race. We believe it is an even trade. However, if you have money, we will be glad to have a cash payment.;;;;
;Listen, I think, it's not fair. ;25;;;
;Hm. Information for information... What do you want to know about my race?;26;;;
;I don't really think I am allowed to give you such information about my civilization. I guess I'll give you only the coordinates.;27;;;
;Hm. So one can exchange information about himself for information about somebody else, am I right? Can I just sell you the information you need?;28;;;
;Your offer flatters us, but, unfortunately, it is useless for us. We already have your coordinates.;29;colony_search.found;;
;You are mistaken, we do have money.;30;credits>6;;
;You know, I want to convene an officer council. We need to discuss this question. Hope, you will understand my decision and won't get me wrong.;31;;;
31;You don't have to worry. It is a rational  decision, it excellently characterizes you. This link will be free, as soon as your meeting ends - connect us immediately. ;;;;
;Thank you. Over.;-1;;10;
29;Oh... What a surprise to meet such a prepared creature. Better for you, the Human commander. In such situation, if you want, you can get a little discount for a first purchase. You'll have a 10% discount on anything you want. Just out of respect for you.  ;;;;
;A discount is always good. So, what about the payment? ;24;;;klisk.discount
30;All the better. If you want to save your money or spend them on another things, we will be glad to exchange information. After all, the Codex says, that money is the most powerful balancer and the best payment, but sometimes it is better to exchange similar things, 'cause it'll make a greater profit in a long run. ;;;;
;What do I need to do if I don't want to make such an exchange or simply I can't do it?;24;;;
28;So you prefer a stable currency, don't you? I think, it may be rational. Sure thing, you can sell your information for credits.;;;;
;How much will you pay for a general information about my nation? And what's the cost of the more more detailed information?;32;;;
32;A stable price for general information is seven credits. Price depends on details. ;;;;
;Hm‰ So, one more time, what do you want for information about races?;24;;;
27;Sure, it's your choice. However, trust me, you are losing a great opportinity...;;;;
;Do you think so?;33;;;
;Anyway, I wouldn't like to wade into those waters. I have a lot of responsibility already, so for now I would like just to have the coordinates.;34;;;
34;Dock now, commender. Glad to see you on this station. Over.;;;;
;Over. ;-1;;;
33;I'm sure you have a lot to offer - and, as for me, I'll find an opportinity to pay for that. The Codex says, if you are in a position to close a transaction - you need to do it, 'cause it brings a mutual benefit and a close friendship. ;;;;
;Good, then let's discuss the terms of trade. What do you want for information about races?;24;;;
;Anyway, I have to refuse.;35;;;
35;It's a pity. However, it's up to you. Anyway, dock now,  the rest we'll discuss in person.;;;;
;Over.;-1;;;
26;It depends on things you want to give. You can just give some basic information about you and your nation. It will be enough to make an exchange. ;;;;
;That's the way I want to do it.;36;;;
;What will I get if my information is more detailed?;37;;;
;I think my question is rather clear: why do you need information about my nation? ;38;;;
;However, I have to refuse.;39;;;
;Say again, what do you want for information about races?;24;;;
36;I'm glad we've come to agreement. Dock now, commander, the dock for your spaceship is ready.;;;;
;Perfect. Over. ;-1;;;
39;It's a pity, but stuff happens. Anyway, if you change your mind, I will be glad to explain it again. Dock now, I have given an order to prepare a dock. You are welcome. ;;;;
;It's a pity, but stuff happens. Over. ;-1;;;
38;Everything is quite simple. Firstly, if you are going to make contacts with other races, you don't have to be... *slow clicks* that dark. That secretive. Secondly, if klisks know you well, their trades will be more profitable, and the other races will understand you better. However, if there is something you're doubting, I will not insist on giving me this information. ;;;;
;Clear. So, what do you want to know?;26;;;
37;It depends on quality and quantity‰ You will have a nice bonus for a full biological report, plus a good historical background. It's hard to say exactly now, you know. ;;;;
;Perhaps, I'm satisfied.;40;;;
;With all due respect, I still need an answer for the question, 'why do you need so detailed informarion about my race?' ;41;;;
;Could you please be more specific? A full biological report and a good historical background - it's a loose concept. ;42;;;
;Let's get back to the methods of payment.;24;;;
;What if I don't want to share all the information? ;26;;;
40;In this case, I will give an order to open the dock. Welcome to the trade station, the Human commander!;;;;
;Thank you for the hospitality. Over.;-1;;;
41;Don't hesitate, it's an obvious question. When we have the information about you, we will have a notion what kind of attendance your nation needs. There's also a general and academic interest. I think you understand the fact that it is impossible to injure you, knowing about your biological and historical information. ;;;;
;You're right, but‰ My nation has certain problems with space, so I don't want to make it worse.;43;;;
;Oh. Then‰ I suppose‰ I agree. ;36;;;
43;Problems with space? *clicks interestedly* Please, tell me more.;;;;
;Let's say, my spaceship isn't the first one humanity has launched to explore the universe. We had another one, now it's lost. I can't tell you more.;44;;;
;It's hard to explain. Nowadays my planet is facing hard times - it's all because of the energy crisis. Besides, the first spaceship has dissapeared, and it hit a raw nerve of our civilization. My spaceship is the second one and the last one, so I have no right to fail my mission. ;45;;;
;It is a secret. I'm not allowed to spill the beans. Hope you'll understand. ;46;;;
46;Oh. *slow clicks* Sure, no offence. You wanted to talk about the quantity of information. ;;;;
;Right. So, what about information? ;37;;;
45;"Oh‰ I feel sorrow for your trouble. *clicks rapidly, then slows down; apparently, klisk is satisfied* Let's back to our question. You talked about different rewards for a different amount of information...  ";;;;
;Yes, of course. Repeat your terms, please. ;37;;;
44;That is interesting. Can you tellme a little bit more? Klisks need any information.;;;;
;Sorry, but no. As I said before, it's closed information. Also, I want to hear your offers for my data. ;37;;;
;The energy crisis chokes my planet. Our first spaceship that was sent to find a planet for a future colonization has dissapeared. As you can understand, a huge resposibility lies on me.;45;;;
;Do you want to get information for free?;47;;;
47;*rapid clicks of laughter* You've learnt a lot during this conversation... Story of you for a story of klisks. Is it a go?;;;;
;Sure. Starting to dock.;-2;;2;
;Unfortunately, no. It is better not to give publicity to some things. You haven't answered the question about my reward yet.;37;;;
42;A biological report is a scan and few tests. Physical, psychological ones... As for the historical background - we'll just need a simple... *it took some time until the device finds an appropriate word* simple book with information. Do you have such things?;;;;
;Do you mean a history book? ;48;;;
48;Yes, you call it so.;;;;
;Hm‰ It is rather profitable. When do we start?;49;;;
;You know, I would like you to tell me some things again. What is the reward for the additional information? ;36;;;
49;As soon as you dock your spaceship, the Human commander. You are welcome. ;;;;
;Thank you. Over.;-1;;;
25;Where are we being‰ *random clicks, now loud, then silent* unfair to you? ;;;;
;Humanity is a young race. We have recently come to space! And you're trying to get us into a strange trade, motivating it with some weird arguments. It seems like a bluff, and, I'm not sure if you know this term - a speculation! ;50;;;
50;I'm not going to deceive you. You have misunderstood me. The Codex -  that's what's important, there is no lie in it. You can have general information, but not more - klisk doesn't want  to share information for free, furthermore - we can't do it, it is very bad. Maybe you just can't get the point, we follow the rules of the Codex. It's our path! ;;;;
;You must be kidding me. Why are you trying to mess with my head? What's the difference between a couple of words and a dozen of them? Why don't you want to help my nation to take a rightful place among you? ;51;;;
;The Codex is your path, you said? I have heard it before. The Path‰ Path‰ Right. The gardener! He was talking about the path! Is your Codex connected with gardeners? ;52;;;
;Fine. I have to agree with you. Can you please repeat the terms?;24;;;
52;Why are you asking?;;;;
;We are looking for a spaceship that has dissapeared recently. When we met for the first time, the gardener let us know that he knew the location of the spaceship, but he refused to give us more detailed information - he said, that it wasn't our path, and we have to find it on our own. ;53;;;
53;Hm‰ Commander, it's hard to explain. Gardeners follow the philosophy of Path. We also follow it, whether we want it or not. Yes, it may be said that the Exchange Codex is partially connected with the philosophy of Path... But just partially. ;;;;
;Okay. What is the philosophy of Path? What's the point?;54;;;klisk.knows_about_path_philosophy
;The Codex‰ tell me about it and its connection with the philosophy of Path. ;57;;;klisk.knows_about_path_philosophy
;How did gardeners get involved in it? Who are they? Gods?;58;;;
;It is all a little bit‰ complicated, though, sure, it all makes sense. Now let me return to the charge: you tried to lie to me. ;50;;;
54;The philosophy of the Path - everything flows, everything changes. Things have certain prices, because if nobody wants to buy it then it is useless. It's hard to explain, the Human commander. You need to understand your own philosophy of the Path. ;;;;
;Well‰ yeah. For me it is quiet hard to understand what you mean, but we had something like that on Earth. I'll take an on-line encyclopedia to check it when I have time. Now let's return to the excharge. Why did you try to lie to me?  ;50;;;
;The Codex‰ tell me about it and its connection with the philosophy of the Path.;57;;;
;How did gardeners get involved in it? Who are they? Gods?;58;;;
57;Klisks follow the Codex from the ancient times. In the beggining, the Codex said what is good and what is bad. What things to follow, and what things to avoid. And now, it has been modified, and it says what is worthy of exchange and what is not. There are things so valuable, that their titles are listed with the exact wording of things they're worth.;;;;
;Hm‰ How do you know what things to exchange and for what to exchange them? Tell me about your Codex and its connection with the gardeners' philosophy of the Path. And how did you find the Codex? ;59;;;
59;Klisks have been following the Codex since the ancient times - from the dawn of my race to its current condition. Information in it was up to time and place. The connection between the Codex and the gardeners' philosophy is very simple - as the philosophy says that opposition creates everything in this life and the Codex states that the true value becomes completely clear only after a deal. Before a deal the object is absolutely usless. Only thing, obtained for a decent price, is valuable. Besides, by getting money to pay the price, you're making a lot of other deals, strengthening yourself in many other aspects. ;;;;
;So, a thing, obtained for a decent price, is valuable, isn't it? What does it mean?;60;;;
60;You should understand it on your own.;;;;
;Okay then. I think we've talked enough, let's get to business‰ You tried to lie, klisk.;50;;;
;How did gardeners get involved in it? Who are they? Gods? ;58;;;
58;Oh, no, gardeners aren't Gods. They have their own Path, and they got farther than the other races. It is all I can say now.;;;;
;No more? ;61;;;
61;More' will include klisks' point of view. You need to know your point of view before knowing others'.;;;;
;It was a little bit rude, though I got the point. I think, we'd talk about it, when I'll understand it better. As for now, why did you try to lie to me? ;50;;;
;Can you give more information about the Codex? What is it? And what is the philosophy of path? ;57;;;
51;Is it so hard to understand? Or  have stopped trying to do that? Commander‰ Commander! Why do you think you can ask for more than we offer?;;;;
;Because, otherwise, my nation will answer with enmity and rage. And, believe me, though we aren't as developed as you are, you'd better beware our rage.;62;;;
;Because in such situation I don't think it's an impudence. I represent those who  are in a much worse position than you are. And any kind of non-cooperation seems like a nonsense or meanness. ;63;;;
62;Oh‰ Sorry. Do you threaten‰ threaten Klisks with war? ;;;;
;You got me right.;64;;;
;No-no, don't say that! It was.. it was a silly joke. Yeah. Just a silly joke.;65;;;
64;*clicks. The klisk turns his back on you and literally emerges from the screen - obviously working with some kind of a computer. Only a few minutes later, he appears on the screen* You have refused to follow the Codex, commander. At the same time, you rejected a gift of Klisks without any obvious reason. Furthermore, the war is bad. It's stupid. In our case, it is irrational and harmful for trade. So here's our answer. Coordinates of capital planets are already sent to you, commander, because we believe in your common sense. But the fear of war makes us stop trading with your people and providing military support for them. I'm afraid, any ammunition,  upgrades, as well as the weapons are unavailable for you now.;;;;
;Wait, it's an absurd!;66;;;
66;No, it's not. You still can buy anything you want around here. But we don't want to sell you weapons that later will be aimed at us. ;;;;
;Listen, wait! *the klisk breaks the private connection, you're staring into an empty screen*;-1;;;
65;A silly joke... Based upon one representative, your nation is stupid, explosive, and unpredictably coward. If you want to threaten klisks, why don't you go to the very end? We don't tolerate such jokes. Now our help is only in your dreams.;;;;
;Listen, it really was a‰;67;;;
67;A silly joke? Do you really think you can afford such jokes in  a serious conversation? I wish you good luck, commander. To be specific, I wish you a good mind. Elsewise, you will have these stupid habits until you face borks.;;;;
;Oh, listen, please!;-1;;;
63;What's our stupidity? What's our meanness?;;;;
;You refused to give us help. This trade is the example of stupidity. Sharing information about your neighbours isn't harder than giving the coordinates of capital planets. We don't need private information, after all! Your meanness is your aggressive refusal! You know, it seems like an attempt to make us do bad things. ;68;;;
68;Well, that's what you think‰ *clicks. As if the klisk is laughting* Why? ;;;;
;What do you mean why?;69;;;
69;Why are you so suspicious? I can understand it from a theoretical perspective, but not from a practical one. Have you seen a lot of wars? With whom? Have somebody tried to subdue your planet?;;;;
;It is strange to hear your surprise. I'm sure, your nation had been at war against each other at least before you went to space. Though, you're right: Earth is an instable planet. There were a couple of world wars on our planet. At the same time, some smaller conflicts haven't quieted down even now. And, trust me, if you don't change your position, there will be more of them.;70;;;
;"Nobody tried to subdue. We - humans - we are... don't know how to call it. Way too agressive? Or just too different? There always were some reasons for war and killing. You know, I could tell you a lot about this, but a couple of phrases will be enough... The first one is ""war is blood, fear and death"". ";71;;;
;Any information costs money, and it's not only me who said this.;72;;;
72;Information about any of the races will be a payment for yours one. See, that makes sense, you've come to a conclusion by yourself. Aren't you satisfied?;;;;
;Indeed‰ Can you remind me the terms, please?;24;;;
70;We‰ don't know if it's strange or not, but we want more details. Is it possible? ;;;;
;You're welcome. We will provide some information. *need to get through to Gordon, give him a command to prepare a data set of Earth's military history*;73;;;
73;*the klisk quickly examines the information. About three minutes, in service. Clicks, expressing his emotions, are silent now, then - quick. He's under the impression* Oh! Oh... How did you... you! You're... you're so strange!  ;;;;
;Eh, sorry?;74;;;
74;You're awful. You're brave. A lot of deaths, such heroism... for what? For... for all these things... You're like borks, but you're not Borks... So terrible... it's so terrible on your planet! Everybody dies, dies! *he continues clicking, talking and galloping away*;;;;
;See now? ;75;;;
75;Yeah! Yes-yes-yes!! Certainly! *he stops clicking* But the Codex‰ I have to take advice! ;;;;
;Apparently, I'll have to wait.;76;;;
76;*It wasn't long until the video screen lights up. The klisk suddenly appears, distracting you from a little sandwich* The consultation is over, the Human commander. ;;;;
;What's the verdict?;77;;;
77;The Codex forbids giving information for no reason. We can't leave you and your planet alone. That's why... we are still offering a trade. Information about you for information about any race. I really want to help you, so I will also tell you about my race, about Klisks. I can't tell you more. The Codex.;;;;
;I have to say, it is rational. Yes, rational, for sure.;78;;;
78;In such case, commander, I give you the green light, you can dock now. Welcome to the station of klisks.;;;;
;Thank you. Docking. Over.;-1;;3;
71;And what about the second phrase?;;;;
;The war never changes. And I know who can tell you about it. *connect Henry, give him a command to join the private communication line with klisk*;79;;;
79;*It took some time. The klisk is shocked, as you can see it by his look* This... this is unbelievable. Such coldness, but such a... ;;;;
;Are you talking about my officer? Or is it about the military history of Earth? ;80;;;
80;Sure, about the military history. There are‰ a lot of wars. So identical and so different people‰;;;;
;I doubt it will make the situation better if you continue to stand your ground and defend your absurd decision.;81;;;
81;Our decision isn't absurd. You just don't understand us, yet now we understand you better. And that's how we see the way out... You will be given the coordinates of capital planets, and you can get information about their races under the same conditions. However, now we understand the situation on Earth better. You really need help. That's why the coordinates of a new planet are ready for sending. It is just a step away from Earth and it is suitable for future colonization. Though, its fauna will be against it... but that's not a problem for such a brave race like yours. ;;;;
;I'm pleasantly surprised you understand the problems of my planet. It's not ideal, but it's better than none.;82;;;
82;Dock then.;;;;
;All correct. Starting to dock. Over.;-4;;4;
