Leader of the European Alliance;europe_leader;They won't come back. It was clear even a month ago, but now it's too obvious to ignore the fact that our most ambitious project has failed.
Leader of the Asian Union;asia_leader;Despite the fact that the first journey brought us several interesting samples, our Union bore great losses, we lost about one hundred billion dollars! You all have seen the reports! There is also a decrease in the index of population happiness. There was nothing like this for fifty years already, since those events in Africa.
Leader of the European Alliance;europe_leader;Have you seen the Aurora-2 project? If you refuse to explore space, the things might become even more complicated. We literally have no choice!

The spaceship will be smaller, but we will use all our experience from the previous project to improve this one. Thus, it will be properly prepared for its mission.
Leader of the Asian Union;asia_leader;But still we've got a lot of problems with finances.
Leader of the European Alliance;europe_leader;According to our reports, there is only one Alliance that have enough money to finance the main part of the project. Obviously, they will have all rights to take the majority of income that Aurora-2 will bring. If it bring any, of course. And I think you all know, about whom I'm talking about...
