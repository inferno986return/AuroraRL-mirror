;;It was only a matter of time before the scientists discover a way to travel faster than light. That's how the ambitious project of creating the first space exploration spaceship was born. This project was called Aurora, after the goddess of the dawn. It was supposed to be a symbol of a new era in the history of the human race.;presentation
;;It took a lot of time and recourses to build the spaceship. However, the first journeys proved that the effort wasn't in vain. The first contact with an alien civilization, the first explorations of other worlds, the first reproduction of a foreign technology - all these things gave humanity a chance at solving the problems. It would take months or even years for Aurora to come back from the trips. But when it finally got home, the people of Earth always celebrated it as the most important holiday in their lives.;story_meeting
