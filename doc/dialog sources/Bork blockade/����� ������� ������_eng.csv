0;*Some creature's fat face appears on the screen. It has a lot of teeth, scaly skin, and it grunts a bit when it breathes.* YOU! Who're you?! ;
;Uhm…;1
1;*The creature grunts again and speaks more loudly, shouting by the time it finishes the sentence.* YOU! BORK IS TALKING TO YOU, YOU ARE TALKING TO BORK! WHO'RE YOU?! MY TURF! MY SPOT! ;
;All right, let's start with this. This is the Aurora 2, my ship. You are blocking my home planet. What gives? ;2
2;"*The creature grunts and speaks just a little more quietly. You can hear roaring in the background: those must be his clansmen.* Hrrraka. This is my ship. Its name is ""The Ship!"" It's good! It's powerful! The Ship is the best ship a Bork has ever had! ";
;What are you doing here?;3
3;Don't interrupt the Bork!! I was talking!! What was I talking about?!! The Ship. The Ship is a ship. I took it from the Klisks. Hrrraka is a smart Bork. I want to rob Klisks again. But I don't have a free spot. They're all taken by others, and they have good, powerful ships too. The Ship is better, but there's only one, and they have many. And I found a new planet! Hrrraka will rob Klisks here!! Klisks are rich! Many Borks came with Hrrraka!;
;If you came to rob the Klisks, why do you bother with other ships? They don't even have hyperdrives! ;4
4;What if they're Klisks?!;
;The Klisks don't even trade with Earth. Not yet, anyway. ;5
5;Lies! Hrrraka can't be fooled! Klisks trade with everyone! ;
;No they don't.;6
6;They do!;
;Not with Earth.;7
7;They do!;
;No!;8
8;Yes!!;
;No!!;9
9;Yes!!!;
;No!!;10
10;Yes!;
;No!;12
12;Yes!!;
;No!;13
13;Yes!;
;Hrrraka, I could blow your scrap heap to pieces, do you understand that? ;14
;No!!;15
;God damn it, it's like arguing with a child. What kind of goods do you need? ;19
;Ufff, I have to get some rest from you. ;-1
14;Ha! Hrrraka take your ship! Hrrraka name her The Ship 2! The Ship 2!!! ;
;I wonder if you're all that dumb.;-1
15;Oh-ha! *Apparently, Hrrraka is laughing.* Good argument! Intelligent! You're good, even though you're not Bork! ;
;Glad to hear it. Maybe you can get your ships away from my planet?;16
16;Hurr. *He thinks.* You're good. But I want to rob. I need a spot. All of them are taken. And smart Borks won't give Hrrraka a spot. ;
;So if I go to the smart Borks and ask for a spot for you, you'll go away? ;17
17;Smart Borks won't give you a spot. You can't fool them. I tried! Hrrraka is smart Bork! But the smart ones are smarter than smart Hrrraka, even though Hrrraka smart. But the smart are still smarter than smart Hrrraka!! Arrrr!! Smart!!! ;
;Right. Hey, what's that behind you? ;18
18;Arrrr?!! *Hrrraka turns around and pants loudly.*;
;If they're all like that, I'll come back to you with good news. I have to go. Don't bother turning back around. ;-1
19;Hrrraka isn't a child! Hrrraka adult!;
;Okay, okay. What kind of goods do you need? ;20
20;*Judging from the computer's suspicious beeping and Hrrraka's actions, you realize that he's trying to send you some files.* Why? You want find the goods for me?!;
;I think I do. I have to lift your stupid blockade somehow. I got your list.;-1
;You know what… NO!;13
