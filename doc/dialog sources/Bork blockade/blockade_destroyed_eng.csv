0;Apparently, the blockade is destroyed.;
;Yeah. I didn't have a choice.;1
1;Okay, but… Have you turned the TV on? The people are panicking, and random scummy prophets are already preaching about the end of the world. You shouldn't have done it.;
;Martan, I didn't have another choice. I really didn't.;2
2;Am I complaining? It's okay… more or less. But you could have tried to do it quieter. You know, if we wanted to destroy the blockade, we could have launched a couple of rockets ourself, couldn't we?;
;You're impossible to please. Anyway, all right. What's done is done, we can't change that. I have to go.;-1
