0;*One of the aliens called the Rogues is looking at you. Behind his back, you can see about a dozen of his compatriots setting up something like a small obelisk, a pole about five meters tall. However, this thing is vibrating and blinking its lights.* I know you. You're humans. By the Essence of the Devourer, I greet you.;
;Devourer? Um… Nevermind. Can I ask you what you're doing here?;1
1;*The Rogue points at the Sun.* We're getting ready to pray.;
;Pray? To our Sun?;2
2;You call it Sun? It has a nice ring to it. We'll pray. Pray to the Essence of the Devourer, and the Essence of your… Sun. I said it right.;
;So you're just going to pray here? No funny business?;3
3;I understand. We only have handguns. And the Altar is just an altar.;
;Well, then. Okay. It's very unusual, but I don't have any right to get in your way. Good luck. I have to go.;-1
