0;What is it, human captain?;;;
;Nothing in particular. I wanted to know if you'd left yet. Obviously you haven't.;-1;;1
;I've brought you the parts. They're being unloaded from the shuttle.;1;rogues_altar.has_items;
1;Great. *The Rogue smiles.* We'll start getting ready to the prayer.;;;
;What's going to happen at the prayer?;2;;
;Are you going to be here long?;4;;
;I won't get in your way, then.;5;;
2;Our prayer is transubstantiation of food into the essense of our sins, and of our bodies into the Essence of the Devourer. The Essence of the Devourer absorbs the essence of sin, giving power and destroying the sinful.;;;
;It sounds pretty weird.;3;;
3;*The Rogue is shy.* I… I could have mixed it up. I'm not an Elder yet, I'm still studying for it.;;;
;Okay, let's not talk about that. Instead of that, tell me, are you going to stay here long?;4;;
;I won't get in your way, then.;5;;
4;The ritual will only take an hour or an hour and a half, not more.;;;
;What's going to happen at the prayer?;2;;
;I won't get in your way, then.;5;;
5;What? You want to leave? Wait. *The Rogue crosses his arms grabbing his shoulders and bows.* I would like to ask you to take part in the prayer, human captain. Please. You've really helped us, and it would be a sin to let you go just like that. *He looks at you almost pleadingly.*;;;
;How can I say no? Okay. What do I do?;7;;
;I'm sorry, but no. I've done all I could to help you, but I'm not taking part in this.;6;;
6;Of course… Yes. As you wish. *The Rogue looks hurt and sad. He walks away towards the Altar.*;;;
;…;-1;;
7;*Finishing the Altar takes about an hour. You try to help, but are gently pushed to the side. The Rogues work very efficiently, and the one who talked to you works more than the rest. He is the one who puts the final part, some kind of small glass sphere, on top of the Altar. Now it's finished. It's towering above you by several yards. It looks... impressive.*;;;
;…;8;;
8;*It all starts when you line up in front of the Altar. The Rogue who was talking to you before comes up to the Altar and faces you.* I'm happy that we're all here today. I... *he is embarrassed for a second* I'm happy, yeah. And I'm also happy that there is a human captain with us. We all know that we wouldn't have all this without him. Thank you, human captain. Ahem.;;;
;Of course, you're welcome.;9;;
;*nod silently*;9;;
9;"*The Rogue points at the sun.* No matter how beautiful it is, it will become the Essence of the Devourer if it has to. No matter how beautiful everything is, it will become the Essence of the Devourer if it has to. What is the Essence of the Devourer? My essence, your essence, His essence. *You don't even notice how the Rogue goes from normal speech to some sort of chant.* What is my essence? My essence is serving Him faithfully. What is your essence, my brothers? *The Rogues answer: ""Our essence is being next to you.* And what is your essence, human captain?";;;
;My essence? My essence is being a good leader and obeying orders for the good of many.;10;;
;My essence is defending my planet and the people who live there.;12;;
;My essence… I don't know. Being human, in the complete sense of the word.;14;;
10;*The Rogue comes up to every one of his people and puts his hand on their foreheads. He whispers something while he does it. In a minute, he comes up to you, too. Rogue skin is soft, but it feels rougher than human skin.* The Essence of the Devourer is in the essences bound in Him. One of His Essences is serving His goal, and this goal is multi-faceted, this goal is unknowable, this goal is endless. What are you, human captain? Human captain. What is your life, human captain? Gaining in the name of service, serving in the name that is not yours. Where are you going, human captain? *Several seconds pass before you realize that it was a question.*;;;
;I go where I'm told to go.;11;;
11;That is admirable, but if you realize that you are a servant, should you be surprised that you have no free will? *What was the Rogue trying to say with that? He goes back to the Altar.*;;;
;…;16;;
12;*The Rogue comes up to every one of his people and puts his hand on their foreheads. He whispers something while he does it. In a minute, he comes up to you, too. Rogue skin is soft, but it feels rougher than human skin.* The Essence of the Devourer is in the essences bound in Him. One of His Essences is making you capable of defending, and making that which is to be defended by you, and making that which is to be defended from. So it is, and when it is no more, it will be so again, and when that is no more, it will be so once more. Is it good or bad? It matters not. What matters is where you are going. Where are you going, human captain?;;;
;I'm going forward.;13;;
13;That is good, but if you only move forward, you miss what is on your left and right, above you and below you... or even behind you? Then why are you surprised that you have no free will? *What was the Rogue trying to say with that? He goes back to the Altar.*;;;
;…;16;;
14;*The Rogue comes up to every one of his people and puts his hand on their foreheads. He whispers something while he does it. In a minute, he comes up to you, too. Rogue skin is soft, but it feels rougher than human skin.* The Essence of the Devourer is in the essences bound in Him. One of his Essences is making you what you are, giving you what makes you human. Giving me what makes me myself. That matters not. Being someone is easy. What matters is where you are going. I know where I am going. But do you?;;;
;I don't know where I'm going.;15;;
15;Do you think that's the best way? A multitude of choices and moves? You are wrong. Without knowing your path, you will not get anywhere. Sometimes, we do need choices, even though they restrict us a little. *What was the Rogue trying to say with that? He goes back to the Altar.*;;;
;…;16;;
16;*You don't know what's going to happen next, but suddenly, the Rogue starts singing.* It truly is noble and just, respectable and proper to praise You, to sing of You, to bless You, to bow to You, to glorify You, to thank You. You. For You are.;;;
;*continue listening*;18;;
;*think about something else*;17;;
17;*You retreat into yourself and don't hear the chant at all. Time passes without you noticing.*;;;
;…;20;;
18; Atop the mountains of Harkatan, we begged Him… *Other Rogues join in.* Our souls suffered dreadfully...;;;
;*continue listening*;19;;
;*think about something else*;17;;
19;The fire lit us, it was the essence of sin. And I ate them, englightening you. My name is the Devourer. *The Rogues sing badly, but they try their best. However, only their leader sings the last line.* And I will devour everything, and I will become the essence of the essences. For I am. I. *He takes a deep sigh, and screams, but the scream is absolutely neutral, without a hint of emotion in his voice.* Am.;;;
;…;99;;
99;"*You realize the Altar was built for a reason. It begins to hum deeply. First it is quiet, but it is growing louder. It's hard to tell when exactly the ground starts shaking, but that too is growing stronger every second. That's not the full extent of the Altar's effect; soon, every Rogue falls to the ground. And you fall down after them. It's as if all your blood suddenly went to your head from the rest of your body. You hear booming sounds in your ears, your heart is throbbing loudly, there is a red film over your eyes. The rumble and the shaking of the ground won't stop. It feels as if old Moon has left its orbit and is flying straight to hell, rotating wildly. Rumble in your head. Rumble around you. Shaking above you. Shaking below you. Where is the sky and where is the ground? Tap tap tap goes the blood dripping from your nose. A little more and...*";;;
;I'm… going… to throw up…;98;;
98;*A moment before you do it stops. It started gradually, but it's over quickly. It's just, bam! and it's over. You're still lying down next to the Altar, shaken up. The Altar itself is steaming and hissing softly. The Sphere that the leader of the Rogues had installed on the top personally has melted and is now several misty stains.* My brothers... my brothers. Get up. *You spend a good forty minutes coming around. But when you do, you realize you've never felt better. It's as if breathing became easier. As if your eyes started seeing better. And the beats of your heart were... lighter.*;;;
;…;20;;
20;*Apparently, the prayer is coming to an end. The Rogue at the Altar, who seems to be feeling okay, takes a small package out of his pocket. He opens it and puts the contents on the Altar. They're small bits of something white. Apparently, it's food.* And let that be the essence of sin, and let the Essence of the Devourer be in us. *Every Rogue walks up, takes his bit, and eats it. Should you come up? Who knows what your reaction to alien food will be?*;;;
;*come up and eat your bit*;21;;
;*come up and take your bit, but don't eat it*;22;;
;Uhm… I can't eat this. I don't know how I'll react to it. You understand, it's alien food.;23;;
21;*It tastes like dry boiled chicken with no salt. The Rogue is looking at you in surprise, but approvingly.*;;;
;…;24;;
22;*The Rogue nods understandingly and smiles.*;;;
;…;24;;
23;Of course. It's obvious. Let this piece be.. *the Rogue smiles and throws the bit on the ground* here. You'll always know where the essence of your sins is. I think that's a good thing.;;;
;…;24;;
24;*That's it. The Rogues started dismantling the Altar, and their leader walks up to you.* Thank you for being with us, human captain.;;;
;Yeah, thank you too. It's been… uhmmm… interesting. But I'd better go now.;25;;
;What was it? This Altar, is… Is it safe?;26;;
25;Of course. *The Rogue crosses his arms again and bows.* Foorko. My name is Foorko. I don't know what I'm going to be later. But I'll always be a friend to the humans. *He turns around and walks to the Altar.*;;;
;*get back to your ship*;-1;;
26;It was transubstantiation of the essence of the Altar into the essence of the essences of the Devourer. Through suffering we, and He, reached relief and happiness. And then food became the essence of our sins.;;;
;It was… Whew. Okay. I have to go now.;25;;
