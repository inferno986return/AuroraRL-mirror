0;*Now you see why the colony's radio operator told you to go by the radio beacon. What was he saying about the sandstorm that would be over in half an hour? It's not over yet, it just let up a little. The shuttle is getting rattled side to side. Sometimes you hear you can hear the urgent alarm system barking something in the cockpit. You don't even want to imagine how the woman and the child are feeling. They don't look so hot, but they seem to be holding on.*;;;;

1;*There's no point in talking, it's too hard to do. You smile and shrug looking somewhat guilty. The woman smiles back and holds the girl tighter.*;;;;
;*look out the window*;2;;0;
;*bear through it and wait for the landing*;3;;0;
2;*You can't see anything except the weakly glowing airport lights. The wind is howling, sand drums on the hull of the shuttle.*;;;;
;*comfort the woman and her daughter*;1;;0;
;*bear through it and wait for the landing*;3;;0;
3;*The shuttle gets thrown around for almost twenty more minutes before it finally manages to land. As soon as it touches the landing pad and stops moving, people wearing anti-exposure suits run up to it, lock in the shuttle's wings and some parts of its hull with magnet anchors. How strong do these storms get if the colonists have to use measures like these? The pilot yells out from the cockpit.* Captain, they've sent a transport for us! It'll be here in a minute!;;;;
;We've landed. Get ready to exit.;4;;0;
4;*Through the howl the of the wind, you can't hear the noise from the car that just arrived. Only a couple of honks make you realize it's time for you to get out. The car turns out to be a military armored transport with the weapon systems taken off, and you have to run towards it: the wind is too strong, the sand whips you in the face too hard. When everybody is in -- you, the pilots, the woman with the girl -- the transport starts to move. The man meeting you takes off first his protection suit's helmet, then the mask.* Glad to meet you, Captain. My name is Matthew. Sorry about all this, it's fall, we're having one cyclone after another. *Then he turns to the woman.* Sinn? And Jodie, I suppose? *The woman nods, the girl keeps silent.* We're about to get there and Rich will meet you personally. He said he was sorry, he had an important meeting. *The transport starts and begins moving.*      ;;;;
;Who are you?;5;;0;
;Why was our request to land approved in such a storm?;6;;0;
;Are you sure nothing is going to happen to our shuttle?;7;;0;

6;That's nothing, sir, it's more or less let up. Half an hour I wouldn't be able to leave the building, it'd pick me up and carry me away. *Matthew guffaws.* And I'm serious, sir. Six months ago, a soldier in full combat gear swept up. It threw him up one kilometer, and then the wind let up and he fell down. I'm sorry about talking about all this in front of the girl, ma'am, but... *He shrugs.*;;;;

7;They locked it in, so it shouldn't. Earth vehicles can take these storms. Our magnet anchors, too. However, I have to warn you that if the wind reaches superstorm strength, our anchors will still hold, but your shuttle will get its wings and nose torn off. But don't worry, superstorms aren't common here. The last one was three years ago, but back then we had earthquakes, too. Terrible times, they were!;;;;

8;Yeah, you're the one who found this planet and helped found the colony, Captain. *Matthew smiles. Now you can see he's missing a few teeth.* I can tell you, you could have found a calmer planet, hahaha! *He guffaws cheerfully, but then turns serious the next moment.* Although, there's a bit of truth to every joke. It was really hard at first. Aggressive flora, fauna, and this weather... you can see for yourself. But we're used to it. Thank God for the shipments from Earth and the aliens we trade with.;;;;
;You trade with the aliens?;9;;0;
10;We have appropriate light transports. But during a sandstorm, we better take this thing. *Matthew slaps the wall with his hand.* Trust my experience, sir.;;;;

13;Yes, sir. *Matthew points at the window.* Can you see those red and green lights? That's our town hall. Mr Rich ordered me to take you straight here. He really wants to see his family. And to talk to you, of course.;;;;
;Straight to business? I can respect that.;14;;0;
9;What can you do? We have to. If we wait for weapons and equipment to be delivered from Earth, you're not going to have a colony anymore!;;;;

14;*Having passed the checkpoint, the armored transport slows down smoothly and stops right in front of the town hall entrance. Matthew puts on the mask again, opens one of the armored transport's doors and runs to the town hall doors. He opens one of them in a way that gives you some cover from the wind and waves at you. What can you do? You're going to have to run!*;;;;
;*inside*;15;;0;
15;*The sand keeps falling off of you. The shuttle pilots have it best, they're wearing their comm helmets, convenient. And you'll have to wash the sand out of your ears later... but you have more important business to attend to. The town hall.*;;;;
;Where to now, Matthew?;18;;0;
;*look around*;16;;0;
18;*Matthew has no time to answer.* Nowhere for now, Captain! Sinn! Jodie! *On the stairway is a burly but athletic middle aged black man. The girl screams and runs to him. The man picks her up and holds her.* My daughter, God... Sinn, come here already! *His wife won't move. Tears are running down her cheeks. The man walks up and hugs her. Then he sets the girl down on the floor, walks up closer.* Captain... I hope you remember me. I definitely do remember you.;;;;
;Of course I remember you. We talked on Earth.;19;;0;
;Of course. You used to serve at the Aurora 2.;19;;0;
;Of course I remember. I'm the one who took you here.;20;;0;metropole_burden.knowledge_proof
16;*Standard reception area of a standard third-rate government building. Gray walls, cheap shaggy carpet on the floor, guards at the entrance. You can't focus your view on anything, it's so dry and faceless. The furniture, the secretaries' work desk at the reception, and even the secretatries themselves look like they were taken from the You're Not Welcome 4000 standard kit. Although, the guards... Something's out of place there.*;;;;
;Where to now, Matthew?;18;;0;
;*guards*;17;;0;
19;You're confusing me with someone... it's okay. You're very busy, it's not hard to forget someone's name. *The man gives you a regular smile.* I'm Rich Donahue, the secretary manager here. You took me here... Captain, at first I wanted our meeting to take place straight after you got here. But now... I can't. I need some time to be with my family. Can we postpone our conversation to the morning? I know it's very important, but...;;;;
;Of course, I understand. You and your family haven't seen each other for too long.;22;;0;
;The sooner we start, the sooner we're done, isn't it?;21;;0;
20;Wow, you do remember me! *The man smiles happily.* But you don't know my name, and don't say you can, we haven't been introduced. I'm Rich Donahue, the secretary manager. And... Captain, I hope you understand... I wanted to have our business meeting right after you got here, but... *Now he's smiling guiltily.* Sinn... Jodie... I haven't seen them in so long... Can we postpone the meeting to the morning?;;;;
;Of course, I understand. You and your family haven't seen each other for too long.;22;;0;
;The sooner we start, the sooner we're done, isn't it?;21;;0;
17;*One of the guards in his heavy armor looks absolutely normal: kevlar with metal plates, some kind of Bork beam gun in his hands. The other one... he doesn't have a helmet. The young guy's head is crossed by a terrible scar that's pulsing with an incredible vessel impossible for a human. This vessel is glowing, it's big. If you look closer, you can see the flickering solid parts of something and fibers... augmentation! The soldier squints displeasedly. He doesn't like the attention.*;;;;
;Where to now, Matthew?;18;;0;
22;Thank you, Captain! *Rich's family join him in his gratitude. The man himself is telling Matthew something. He nods and gestures for you to follow him. He goes to the employee area.* I'm sorry, Captain. *Matthew shrugs.* Rich really loves his family, he really does. He's missed it.;;;;
;It's all right. Where are we going?;23;;0;
21;*What does it cost him to stay as impassive? He turns to his family. You can't see his face, but he's almost definitely smiling happily.* Our captain is right! Business first, rest later... Matthew will walk you, you can wait for me at your quarters. *Matthew nods and walks away, taking Rich's family with him.* Please follow me to my office, Captain. If you want to talk now, we'll talk now. *Rich is going to the second floor. All you can do is follow him there.*;;;;
;*follow Rich*;-1;;1;metropole_burden.instant
23;To the employee quarters. *Matthew smiles.* People here won't be able to get back home often enough, so there are places in every building where they can spend the night and wait out the weather. *This service wing looks like some barracks, even if it looks more presentable. True, there are no rows of double bunk beds, but a row of cheap doors is gloomy just the same.* One of the best rooms for you, Captain. *Matthew stops in front of one of the doors and opens it with a key.* Deluxe, you could say, hah. There's TV, infonet... It's like the internet but much smaller-scale. Get some rest. Someone will come for you in the morning.;;;;
;And my people?;24;;0;
;Thank you, Matthew.;25;;0;
24;I'll take care of them, too. *Matthew nods.*;;;;
;Thank you, Matthew.;25;;0;
25;Of course. Have some good rest. *Taking your pilots with you, Matthew walks down the corridor. All you have left to do is walk into the room... well, it could have been worse, right? On the other hand, if this is deluxe, what are the other rooms like? The room is small, and it looks smaller than it is because of badly arranged furniture. There's a military bunk bed by the window, covered with a blanket, also military. Next to the bed is a bedside table, and next to that is a desk with a computer on it, turned off for now. That's not counting the fridge and the bookshelf. From the room you can walk to the bathroom.*;;;;

Mostly it's boring reports, there are a lot of them: from those describing the output of Uranium mines to those that regulate the routes of street cleaners.*;;;;
;Hm. What's this, then?;42;;0;
42;*You've found something. In a small text file is a simple table. It lists, with an almost devil-may-care simplicity and precision, how much of the processed resources were sold to the aliens. Sometimes they paid in credits. Sometimes in vehicles, but it doesn't say what it was exactly. Interesting data.*;;;;
