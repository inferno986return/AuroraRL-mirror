0;*Rich screws up his face and shakes his head, looking annoyed this time.* Look, I know you couldn't care less, but you could at least pretend you cared more than that! The documents are about regulating our colony's trade with aliens, taxes imposed on our colony's merchants, and trade tariffs, and that's just scratching the surface! You want to know my opinion? Earth is strangling us! And you're helping them do it, and you don't even know! How heroic! *He looks angry. But not so angry that striking a deal with him would be impossible, although it's not going to be easy. Some meetings you should really prepare for...*;;;;
;Trade relations between the colony and aliens, Rich. What's wrong with them?;-1;;1;
;Taxes. You don't like taxes? No one does.;4;;;
;Tariffs. Do you think they're too high?;12;;;
1;Captain, let's be honest: none of the Aurora Project's demands are what Earth needs directly. Aurora do need them, though. Please stop pulling the wool over my eyes. *Rich reclines in his chair.* I've studied the documents you sent, even though I didn't really have to, it's more of the same thing. Strict regulation of trade for the colonial merchants, raising the taxes and the tariffs... and that's far from all. I'm not going to sign it. *He looks serious, a little tired and annoyed, but not closed off. You can still talk him into it, if you really try.*;;;;

2;I respect your serious and honest position, Captain. No, seriously. *Rich nods and rubs his hands.* It's much better than those boring attempts at emotional manipulation. But then you will understand me as well. Captain, I can't sign those documents. I can't ruin our relations with the aliens, they're shaky as it is. I can't change the taxes and tariffs for colonial merchants... and the rest of it too... no, Captain. I'm sorry. *Rich nods and reclines in his chair. He looks pleased with himself, but... seems like he's a little taken aback by your directness. Well, all the better. You can try talking him into it.*;;;;

4;The Earth merchants from Aurora do. *Rich is speaking very softly.* You know why? Because they pay almost no taxes.;;;;
;How come?;5;;;
5;They work for the government. They get gigantic tax breaks. Colonial merchants are forced to scale back their trade, no one is letting them near government contracts. With all these taxes they can't expand, their businesses are doomed to stagnate! I can't sanction further tax raises, Captain. I refuse to do it.;;;;
;Let me direct: how do you benefit, Rich? I know you trade with aliens, but the deals are small scale, it's barter. They don't get taxed at all.;8;metropole_burden.klisk_station_visited && metropole_burden.rogue_station_visited && metropole_burden.bork_station_visited && metropole_burden.documents_found;;

;I understand. Could we reach a compromise?;7;;;
;You don't want to sign it? Don't, then. Moving on.;3;;;metropole_burden.taxes_signed=false
6;But I will argue about it. Because there's no other way. If I sign this document, the taxes will be even higher, colonial merchants won't be able to trade at all!;;;;

7;You may think it's weird, Captain, but in some things, compromise is impossible. Raising taxes would hurt the colony too much. I can't let it happen. *Rich is sullen and serious, he is absolutely not in the mood for a conversation.*;;;;

8;Wow, Captain. *Rich smiles sadly. He doesn't look annoyed, just tired.* I can only applaud your methods of getting information... and you don't have to believe me, of course, but in this case, I really just want to make a decision that would benefit the colony. Raising taxes would make business more difficult for our colonial merchants, and would make it easier for the Earth ones. People from Earh have it too easy here as it is. Colonists get no say.;;;;
;What about you?;9;;;
9;You of all people should see that my post here is bogus! *Secretary Manager sighs.* If I refuse to sign something, they pressure me into it. Like right now, you've got me up against the wall. How can I refuse to sign anything if you know about the deals we do? Sure, they're relatively legal... relatively. But they won't be happy about it on Earth. So what do I do? I can't do anything else. I'm ready to put my signature on it.;;;;
;I'm sorry, Rich. This is for the best of our planet.;10;;;
;Rich… I understand. And even if I could get in trouble for this… let's put it aside. You don't have to sign the part about raising taxes.;11;;;
10;*Richard signs the document, adding quietly:* Who said Earth was still my homeworld?;;;;
;…;3;;;metropole_burden.taxes_signed=true
11;I'm glad we reached an understanding, Captain. Trust me… it has to be this way.;;;;
;…;3;;;metropole_burden.taxes_signed=false
12;Unreasonably high. *Having agreed, Rich takes the glass of water standing next to him and empties almost half of it.*;;;;
;Why?;13;;;
13;Because those tariffs don't stay in the colony. The money flows to Earth, leaving us with nothing. By raising the tariffs, we'll give the aliens even less reason to trade with us openly. I don't want to create smugglers in my colony!;;;;
;But Earth needs it.;14;;;
;That's strange. You're left with nothing at all?;15;;;
;You do understand you still have to sign it?;16;;;
;I think you're right. I agree with you.;18;;;metropole_burden.dues_signed=false
14;Captain, seriously, listen to yourself! *Rich stands up a little and hangs over the desk, propping himself up on his hands.* Earth this, Earth that... And there are people living here at the colony, too! And we have it hard, too! Don't you see that Earth isn't just milking us, it's draining us dry!;;;;
;That's strange. You're left with nothing at all?;15;;;
;You do understand you still have to sign it?;16;;;
;I think you're right. I agree with you.;18;;;
15;That's the thing, nothing. *He smirks.* Even if I wanted to do something about it, I couldn't. Everything is controlled by Earth people, I'm powerless here.;;;;
;You do understand you still have to sign it?;16;;;
;I think you're right. I agree with you.;18;;;metropole_burden.dues_signed=false
16;*Rich gets up and walks over to the bookshelf. He's talking while standing with his back to you.* Amazing. So many books about politics... I thought I'd learn something, but I couldn't. *He turns to face you. Secretary Manager is very tense, if you look closely, you can see his hands trembling lightly.* Do you really want to me to sign this document? I would have to do it because I don't have any serious reasons to refuse. But trust me, it would only hurt the colony.;;;;
;I'm sorry, Rich. This is what you have to do.;17;;;
;I think you're right. I agree with you.;18;;;
17;As you wish.;;;;
;…;3;;;metropole_burden.dues_signed=true
18;I know, you're going to have a hard time explaining this one, but… thank you, Captain. I appreciate your understanding so much.;;;;
;Don't thank me. I understand.;3;;;metropole_burden.dues_signed=false
19;Want me to show you something? *Rich goes through one of the drawers of his massive desk, then takes out a thick stack of documents.* At least have a glance at these.;;;;
;What are these?;20;;;
;*look through the documents*;21;;;
20;Take a look yourself. I think you'll find it interesting.;;;;
;*look through the documents*;21;;;
21;*In the stack, there are many official requests of all kinds. Among them: request to grant outstanding graduates of colonial schools benefits when applying for Earth higher education, denied. Request to provide additional ammunition and weapons to form additional colonial militia forces, denied. Request for additional medical budget funds... also denied.* Can you see a certain pattern emerging? *Rich points at some of the sheets.* I ask them to send some more troops, they accept that, send over some conscripts. I ask for permission to raise the number of our militia squads, they deny it. I ask them to send over new specialists, they send them and we pay them. I want to train our own specialists, they deny it. I ask for permission to trade with aliens, they deny it...;;;;
;But you trade with them anyway, as we've found out. Maybe it's the same with everything else, I don't know.;22;metropole_burden.klisk_station_visited && metropole_burden.rogue_station_visited && metropole_burden.bork_station_visited && metropole_burden.documents_found;;
;In other words, they're strangling the colony. Making it stagnate…;23;;;
22;I understand your scepticism, Captain. *Rich looks embarrassed.* But I've told you already, those are desperate measures. And about everything else I just listed, you can look through those documents yourself.;;;;
;Why are you telling me this?;24;;;
23;Exactly, Captain. *Rich nods.* Earth wants to use us as a resource colony, nothing more than that.;;;;
;Why are you telling me this?;24;;;
24;Whatever the outcome of our conversation is, Captain, whether I sign the documents you brought or not, things at the colony aren't going to get much better. Like I said, they're strangling us, not letting us develop. And if you agreed to help us... *He squints so hard he inadvertenly bares his lower teeth.* At least talk to Martan Kilmovee, show these requests to him! Maybe that would help us in some way!;;;;
;Okay. I'll discuss this with Martan.;26;;;metropole_burden.bring_colony_requests=true
;I'm sorry, Rich, but that's above my pay grade.;25;;;metropole_burden.bring_colony_requests=false
25;*Your response is a brusque:* I understand, Captain. *Rich is silent after that.*;;;;
;What did we settle on, Rich?;-1;;;
26;*Secretary Manager gives you a pleased smile, relieved.* Great. Even if you don't manage to do anything, at least you tried. It'll be a great help to us.;;;;
;So what did we settle on, Rich?;-1;;;
