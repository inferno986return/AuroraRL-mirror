0;We had it very hard when we had just founded the colony. *Secretary Manager drums his fingers on the desk and looks at you with some kind of superiority.* I'll be direct and honest: Earth abandoned us. And a big reason why we survived was our trade with the aliens. Klisks, Borks, Rogues... You could say they saved us. And now they want to ban us for selling them the surpluses of processed resources, even though we barely trade with the aliens already anyway... Earth wants to make us completely dependent on itself!;;;;

4;Yes, I know you've been through my files. Obviously I shouldn't have set my daughter's name as the password... *Rich smirks, then grins nastily.* But you mixed up your dates, Captain. You saw an old report and cost sheet. They're almost two years old. Now we barely trade with the aliens, like I said. And it's not benefitting the colony at all.;;;;
