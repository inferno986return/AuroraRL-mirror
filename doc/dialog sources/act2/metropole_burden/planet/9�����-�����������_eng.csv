0;*In an hour or two, the still accomodating Matthew walks you from your room to the hall where the press conference takes place.* I saw that one, the one you had on Earth a few years ago. *Matthew smiles as he walks down the hallways.* Tons of people there! The one we're doing is smaller, obviously. Basically, you're just going to tell the local big wigs what you've achieved and that's it.;;;;
;Local big wigs? What about the media?;1;;0;
;*walk in silence*;2;;0;
1;We've got two newspapers, a radio station and a small TV channel. Of course, there's going to be a few people from Earth, but the time it's going to take the news to reach Earth, pft! *Matthew shakes his head and squints.* It's modest and low profile, Captain.;;;;
;*walk in silence*;2;;0;
2;*Finally, you're there. Matthew wasn't wrong, it's a little hall with a small speaker's stand, Rich already standing behind it. Several rows of unsightly seats, not all of them are taken. Just a couple of cameras and three microphones. The atmosphere is very homey.*;;;;
;*walk towards the stand*;3;;0;
3;And there he is! *Rich shakes your hand.* Captain, makes yourself at home. Gentlemen, I don't think this man needs any introduction. Captain of the Aurora 2, it's thanks to him that we're all here tonight. The captain has arrived to settle some of the questions of our colony's foreign policy. Captain? *He obviously expects you to continue.*;colony_leader_dialog;;;
;Yes, that's exactly right. The purpose of my trip was regulating the colony's economic relations. It mostly concerned raising the taxes and the tariffs collected from colonial businesses during trade. However, we talked about some other subjects... such as trade with the aliens and shipments from Earth. We've reached a consensus.;4;;0;
4;* Here comes question number one. The man who takes the floor is thin and wearing a three-piece suit that's about one size too big for him. His hands are rough and covered in blisters.* Jackson Hombre, CEO of Unity Spoil. What about the taxes, Captain? I'm going to be directly affected by it, my business is small and I don't have any contracts with Earth.;;;;
;Taxes for businesses that have contracts with the Aurora Project stay the same. Taxes for local businesses have been raised. These are temporary measures taken entirely because of the energy crisis on Earth. In the course of the next review, that part will definitely be revised.;5;metropole_burden.taxes_signed=true;0;
;Taxes for businesses that have contracts with the Aurora Project stay the same. Same for the taxes for private colonial enterprises. It's not forever, of course. In the course of the next review, that part will be revised. But as of right now, this is how it's going to be.;6;metropole_burden.taxes_signed=false;0;result=result+1
5;*The man shuts his lips tight. Nonetheless, he nods and sits back down. A man standing next to one of the big TV cameras raises his hand.* Maksim Swami, We Are Colonists! newspaper. Now that we've touched upon the taxes... what about the tariffs? Have they been raised, too? I mean for private enterprises, of course...;;;;
;Yes, the tariffs too. The situation on Earth is extremely dire. As of this moment, this is simply unavoidable.;7;metropole_burden.dues_signed=true;0;
;No, the tariffs haven't been raised.;8;metropole_burden.dues_signed=false;0;result=result+1
6;*The man's expression doesn't change. He nods and sits back down, relieved. After that, he takes out a handkerchief and wipes his forehead. Now a man sitting next to one of the big TV cameras raises his hand.* Maksim Swami, We Are Colonists! newspaper. Now that we've touched upon the taxes... what about the tariffs? Have they been raised, too?;;;;
;Yes, the tariffs too. The situation on Earth is extremely dire. As of this moment, this is simply unavoidable.;7;metropole_burden.dues_signed=true;0;
;No, the tariffs haven't been raised.;8;metropole_burden.dues_signed=false;0;result=result+1
7;Well, then, do you really think it's so unavoidable? *The reporter looks like he heard exactly what he expected.* What do you think, personally?;;;;
;In my opinion, raising the tariffs is justified.;9;;0;
;I think a tariff freeze is needed.;10;;0;
;No comment.;11;;0;
8;That is certainly going to make our businessmen very happy. *The reporter looks surprised.* What is your personal opinion about this question?;;;;
;In my opinion, raising the tariffs is justified.;9;;0;
;I think a tariff freeze is needed.;10;;0;
;No comment.;11;;0;
9;Yes, I understand. This is definitely what Earth badly needs! *The reporter smiles, leaving no doubt that there was no sarcasm or irony whatsoever in what he said, and sits back down.*;;;;
;You! That's right, you! Next question.;13;;0;
;*look around*;12;;0;
10;*The reporter nods and thanks you quickly, then sits back down. He looks a little confused.*;;;;
;You! That's right, you! Next question.;13;;0;
;*look around*;12;;0;
11;That's a shame, Captain. Are you afraid of saying the wrong thing, or do you just care so little? *The reporter chuckles and smiles.* Don't answer, Captain. *He sits back down.*;;;;
;You! That's right, you! Next question.;13;;0;
;*look around*;12;;0;
13;Sirio Forrel. *This chubby man, like the one who asked the first question, looks a little exhausted, which is very strange. He's got bags under his eyes from lack of sleep. His three-piece suit, almost exactly like the first man's except it's blue, is a couple of sizes too big, as well. However, that fact is less obvious in his case.* I represent the Colonial Merchants Union... When will we be allowed to trade with the aliens again, Captain?;;;;
;For now it's going to stay as it is, Mr Donahue and I couldn't reach a compromise. I'll relay his demand to allow local traders to do business with the aliens.;14;metropole_burden.embargo_signed=false;0;result=result+1
;That's forbidden in the best interests of Earth. Temporarily, of course.;14;metropole_burden.embargo_signed=true;0;
12;*Right, after the first ten minutes you can take another look at this place. You can tell right away which ones came to the conference on business and which ones did for no real reason, see who's really nervous and who isn't... All of them here, some sitting in their chairs, some standing next to the cameras -- and some of them even standing next to the hall entrance -- look like they belong. Despite their nerves, they're part of this hall, they create the atmosphere here, and you can feel that.*;;;;
;You! That's right, you! Next question.;13;;0;
14;*Sirio Forrel sits back down. He exchanges some whispers with the people sitting around him. You can see now they're sitting apart from everybody else, staying close to each other. After that, a silence falls in the hall, which is interrupted by Rich.* Aside from that, we discussed the question of our requests to Earth... as you know, we have repeatedly asked to increase our medical budget, and to grant the graduates of our schools some benefits when applying to universities and colleges on Earth... Captain? *Rich is looking right at you.*;colony_leader_dialog;;;
;Yes, of course. I promise to personally see it through.;15;metropole_burden.bring_colony_requests=true;0;result=result+1
;I've already told you it's not my call, Rich… In this case, there's nothing I can do.;15;metropole_burden.bring_colony_requests=false;0;
15;*Rich nods.* That'll be all… Gentlemen, the press conference is over. *He addresses the audience with words appropriate for the moment. People begin to get up and leave.*;colony_leader_dialog;;;
;*what comes next?*;16;result=4;0;
;*what comes next?*;17;result>0 && result<4;0;
;*what comes next?*;18;result=0;0;
16;*People are leaving the hall. Looks like the colonists are pleased. There's an atmosphere of satisfaction in the air, it's like the colonists hadn't expected to hear what they heard. How about that. The reporter who asked you a question even walks up to shake your hand, the others leave the hall in silence. Among the last to leave is a man who was standing at the exit the entire time. He looks pretty unremarkable, a simple man wearing a simple business suit like many others here, but his eyes... There's something strange in them, something ominous, something secret and conniving. Nonetheless, the man leaves, simply looking at you for the last time. That's it. The press conference is over. Time to get back to the Aurora.*;;;;
;[END];-1;;0;
17;*People are leaving the hall. They're definitely on edge. Not all of them, of course, not even close, but a few of them are definitely annoyed and dissatisfied as they leave. Although, what can you do? One of the last to leave is a man who was standing at the exit the entire time. He looks pretty unremarkable, a simple man wearing a simple business suit like many others here, but his eyes... There's something strange in them, something ominous, something secret and conniving. Nonetheless, the man leaves, simply looking at you for the last time. That's it. The press conference is over. Time to get back to the Aurora.*;;;;
;[END];-1;;0;
18;*People are leaving the hall... almost run out from it, in fact. They're dissatisfied and annoyed. Rich looks at you reproachfully, but what can you do? What's done is done. Everybody is leaving, but one man is making your way towards instead. You remember that he was standing next to the exit throughout the whole press conference... He doesn't look dangerous: just a man wearing a three-piece suit, a lot of people wear them around here. But his eyes... Walking is hard for him, everybody is trying to walk out of here too fast.*;;;;
;Rich… who is that?;19;;0;
19;*Rich doesn't get to answer because the man gets intercepted by Matthew. He's not alone, there are two soldiers at his side.* Won't give it a rest, will you? *Matthew smiles very nastily.* What's that you got in your inside pocket, buddy?;colony_leader_dialog;;;
;Who's that?;20;;0;
20;*The man bites his lip, reaches into his inside pocket, and the next moment he moves his arm suddenly, trying to throw something at you. Of course, he doesn't get to do it: one of the soldiers pushes him under the arm and knocks him down with a rough leg sweep. The man falls down and screams:* You're just like the rest of them! You're no hero! *Weird. How could you have misjudged him so seriously? You only now realize that he's very young, almost a teenager, even if he's tall and unusually developed for his age.* One of the local activists, Captain. A miner. Don't mind them, they aren't dangerous... *Matthew gets down on one knee and picks up what he was trying to throw at you.*;;;;
;Show me.;21;;0;
;He's almost a child… why is he working in the mines?;23;;0;
;*look at the activist*;24;;0;
;I have to get back to the Aurora.;25;;0;
21;It's just a piece of clay. *Matthew fidgets with the blue lump, about as big as a newborn's head.* That's what it's like in our mines. Although... what's it covered with? *Indeed, the clump is sprayed with something sticky, dark red, with some lumps in it...*;;;;
;Matthew, it's blood. Stale blood.;22;;0;
23;Because he's of age. *Matthew stands up and looks around. There's almost no one left in the room, only a few people are standing there watching what's happening.* Old enough to work in a mine. *Matthew goes into the pocket of the prostrate youth and takes a pack of cigarettes out of it.* And to smoke, as we can see, and to be a member of the local radical political party, right? This isn't the first time they've tried to do action art, Captain. At least it's unarmed, thank God.;;;;
;Show me.;21;;0;
;*look at the activist*;24;;0;
;I have to get back to the Aurora.;25;;0;
24;*You can get a better look at him now. It really is a youth, tall and muscular. His hands are very rough, with skin peeled off from some parts of his hands, and cracks where the skin is particularly dry. His hair is short, dark. He's almost bull necked. Blue eyes. He stares at you, challenging and angry, but when you stare back he can't take it and looks away.*;;;;
;Show me.;21;;0;
;He's almost a child… why is he working in the mines?;23;;0;
;I have to get back to the Aurora.;25;;0;
25;Of course, Captain. *Rich comes up closer.* Someone will take you there.;colony_leader_dialog;;;
;What happens to him?;26;;0;
;*leave*;-1;;0;
22;Yes! It's blood! *The activist, still lying down on the floor, is looking at you almost hatefully.* Our blood! Choke on it, you bastard!;;;;
;He's almost a child… why is he working in the mines?;23;;0;
;*look at the activist*;24;;0;
;I have to get back to the Aurora.;25;;0;
26;*Rich looks at the activist.* Him? He'll get fined and spend a few nights in jail. After all, he hasn't done anything that bad. Many people would like to do the same thing... *Rich shakes his head and frowns.* But that's a different story. Time for you to go, Captain.;colony_leader_dialog;;;
;*leave*;-1;;0;
