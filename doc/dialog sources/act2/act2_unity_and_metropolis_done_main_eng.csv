0;*No matter how much of a hero and a celebrity you are, you can't get through to Martan. How does it feel, waiting in line for the first time in years? Admit it, it feels peculiar. Finally, you are let through. Martan is already waiting. As always, he's wearing his shirt and vest, without a jacket. As always, he smells of the same cologne. If it wasn't for the wrinkles and some more gray in his hair, it's as if he hasn't changed at all, as if the years never happened.* There you are. *Martan extends his hand.* If someone else had gone instead, we'd be worried by now. But you were handling the Aurora. Everybody knew you'd be back.;;;;
;How could I not? *shake his hand*;1;;;
1;*Martan sits in his chair.* Exactly. The space explorer's burden, how could you not have it? Huh? Okay. I understand it you're done with your objectives. Report.;;;;

;That's it.;29;reply_colony_used && reply_unity_used;;
2;And?;;;;
;And what? It all started with an ambassador conference, they even called me there. And there was a Gardener there, too. Not personally, of course. But it wasn't a direct connection either. He sent over a recording.;3;;;
3;*Martan listens to your tale attentively. It turns out very long, you can't just summarize it. Sometimes he interrupts you.* So they allowed us to have our little fisticuffs and promised not to involve themselves? Very noble. I'm sure that if we begin to win, they'll start to help the Zorsan. And if they start to win, they'll help us... great. What happened next? *And he listens to you again. All you have left to do is tell him. By the end you're surprised, since Martan doesn't seem fazed at all by what the Gardener did. Martan nods and reclines in his chair, stretching his neck in side-to-side movements.*;;;;
;Don't you get it? It turns out he knew what we were going to say! He just sent over a recording he had made earlier!;4;;;
4;So what? *Your boss looks at you lazily and sceptically.* First, it could have been a montage of some sort, have you thought about it? Second, even if the Gardener can really... *Martan squints, annoyed, and wiggles his fingers in the air* SEE THE FUTURE, then he hasn't used it to help us or anybody else yet. That's not what we should be thinking about right now. What about the ambassadors?;;;;

9;Exactly. *Martan nods.* They're an obvious enemy, even honest in a way, dealing with them is very simple. With the other races, like Klisks or the Rogues, it's much more complicated. What else?;;;;

11;I see. Good job. *Martan smiles, then continues in his usual voice.* It's a good thing that you paid him a visit. He may be a professional, but being in charge at a place like that means a lot of pressure. Don't forget to visit him regularly. He'll probably have some valuable data, or you'll be able to help him somehow. You understand, sometimes you have to put some physical pressure on in a deniable way.

23;Of course. There was always going to be smuggling in a place that's so far away from the home country. It's a problem, sure, but Project Aurora is still ready to put up with it for now.

24;Augmented? What, at the colony? *Your boss frowns and looks something up on his tablet.* Weird. No one sent any systems like that there. So far it's a secret prototype.;;;;

26;Because Project Aurora needs it. *Martan's voice becomes very acidic, he's speaking mockingly, sarcastically.* Because in case you haven't noticed, there's an energy crisis on this planet. And some space empire wants to go to war with us. Not to mention there's some giant spaceship, a chtonic thing, wants to destroy our sun. Really, where do we get off taking resources from the place we came to take resources from?;;;;
;But people live there, too. They're having a very hard time because of that.;27;;;
27;Those people agreed to come there themselves. That's their duty. And if they're unhappy, that's their problem. They knew what they were doing, didn't they? *That's a solid argument. However, Martan's voice warms a little.* I know, buddy. You're worried. It's all right. The top brass of the Aurora Project aren't sadists or tyrants. Trust me, as soon as we deal with at least one of the threats, we'll cool it with the colony. But right now, there's no other way.;;;;

29;Good. You're dismissed for now. *After a small pause, Martan adds.* Relatively speaking. You still have to try to find out something about the Obliterator. And the Zorsan, of course…;;;;
;I don't get it, are you trying to send me to war? The Aurora 2 is a research craft.;30;;;
30;Reasearch craft with a possible modification into a military one. So yeah. If it comes to that, you're going to war. *Martan smiles.* But we don't need that for now, we don't want you to do anything like that so far. The command wants your help with recon. Just go to a certain place and scan a few planets. You don't even have to engage in combat, should anything happen. The important thing is that you hurry. It's very important.;;;;
;Help with recon? I want to know more.;-1;;;
