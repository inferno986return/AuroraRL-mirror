0;Hey, how have you been all these years? I've been meaning to ask you for a long, long time.;;;
;Ahem… I got distracted… It was hard. Like, really hard… Martan, was I called in here?;1;;0
1;*Martan squints.* It was hard? Why is that?;;;
;It's not that easy being a hero. Mostly because of the administration work. I'd rather if they left me flying the Aurora. You know, this promotion definitely hasn't helped me. Every year out of these five feels like two. Maybe even three.;2;;0
;Let's get to the point.;7;;0
2;Oh? *It's very clear from the way Martan looks that he wants to listen some more.*;;;
;All those Aurora subdivisions opened, and me as the face of the damn project… Meetings, conferences, events... I'll be honest, the Battle of Earth was easier. Much easier.;3;;0
;Let's get to the point.;7;;0
7;It's all so complicated… This war, the colony, and the Obliterator… I don't even know where to start.;;;
;What's up with the Zorsan?;8;;0
;Colony? What's wrong with the colony?;13;;0
;Don't even talk to me about the Obliterator.;16;;0
3;So why did you never contact us? I was beginning to think you thought you were better than us.;;;
;If only I had the time.;4;;0
8;The Zorsan keep sending tiny invasion forces, which we keep blowing to bits. They're afraid of sending the main force. Meanwhile, we'd like to attack, but we can't do that: defending Earth is first priority.;;;
;Go on.;9;;0
13;This one's simple. We need some supplies and a bunch of documentation delivered. *Martan sighs.* I hate all this corporate busywork, can't take it anymore. Basically, we need the head of the colony to sign a bunch of paperwork.;;;
;What if he refuses?;14;;0
16;Right. The Obliterator… that name is spot on. I think telling you about it would be silly. You know more than I do.;;;
;All you have to know is that it makes our sun age.;17;;0
4;*Martan reaches under the desk and takes out a bottle of... what do you know, it's rum. He pours a little into two glasses, then Martan hands you one, keeping the other.* I know you quit a long time ago. Still... it's been a long time, buddy.;;;
;It really has. *drink*;5;;0
9;Getting the aliens' help was hard too... until now. *Martan shakes his head.* About a month ago they declared the war had been going on too long and threatened to grow into something they don't like. Basically, they announced that they wanted to create some kind of organization to regulate political relationships between the peoples of the inhabited parts of the Universe.;;;
;Smells of a convention. Do they want to… regulate our war with the Zorsan? What for?;10;;0
14;You could put a gun to his head. *Martan smiles.* And I'm being serious. *He stops smiling.* There's a ton of money in this, buddy. And a lot of resources the Aurora needs.;;;
;Since when can you make a hero become a gangster?;15;;0
17;That's the thing. Ten years. That's all we have left. If we can't handle it by then, we'll have to move everybody we can to the colony. And we don't want to do that.;;;
;So what do you want from me?;18;;0
5;*Martan coughs, puts the bottle back and leans back in his chair. He breathes out.* Same old for us. Except there's more people now, it's the Head Office of the project, after all. And they gave me a raise. The wife is happy. Kids, too. Aliens walking around, too, who would have thought... Remember the colonel who taught military history at our academy? Well, the old bastard transferred here three years ago. And then he died a year and a half later. That's it. *Martan shakes his head and says nothing.*;;;
;How's your family?;6;;0
;Yeah, there's not a lot of news, as I can see. Okay. Let's get to the point.;7;;0
10;*Martan shrugs.* Hard to say. Whatever it is, they demand an authorized representative from Earth at the organization's HQ... and you're the one who's going to give them one. We can't send anybody else, you understand. You're a person of considerable clout.;;;
;So many questions…;11;;0
15;Haha. Really funny. *Martan takes a bundle of documents out of the drawer.* I know, just looking at them gives you the blues, but you have to study them. Seriously, try to find the time. Something like that. And one more thing... the head of the colony's family. They're coming with you as passengers. You just have to get them there.;;;
;Okay. What next?;12;;0
18;Do you think it's that simple? One thing's clear: you're the only captain we have that all aliens know and respect. Except maybe the Zorsan. If one of us has to try to find some kind of solution with them, obviously it's you. And of course, you've got the carte blanche for any actions. You can even start a second war if you have to. And that's not a joke.;;;
;Okay. What next?;12;;0
6;"Ntanda is fine. As usual. My son… *Martan makes fists.* He fell in with those... the anti-space crowd. ""We shouldn't screw around there, humans should stay on Earth!"" Although, the boy's 15. He'll grow out of it.";;;
;Okay. Let's get to the point.;7;;0
11;And I can't give you any answers. You'll talk to the authorized representative, he'll explain everything much better than I could.;;;
;Okay. What next?;12;;0
12;Lots of things. The war, the colony, the Obliterator. I could explain something something for you again, if you didn't get it.;;;
;What's up with the Zorsan?;8;;0
;Colony? What's wrong with the colony?;13;;0
;Don't even talk to me about the Obliterator.;16;;0
;I think that's enough. So… when am I flying out? And on what?;19;;0
19;Actually, we wanted to give you a fighter ship, something like The Voyager. *Martan pulls a sly grin and shakes his finger.* But... you're on a research mission, aren't you?;;;
;Aurora 2?!;20;;0
20;And with the exact same crew! *Your boss spreads his hands dramatically, looking very pleased with himself.* Although I'll admit it was hard to get Gordon back on his post. When we took him out of his laboratory, he couldn't understand at all what we wanted from him. The man got lost in his work, that happens. ANyway, he's okay now. And he's ready to serve under you, too.;;;
;Gordon…;21;;0
;Sarah…;22;;0
;Henry…;23;;0
;It'll be a pleasure getting back on my good old Aurora 2… When do I take off? And what am I to take care of first?;25;;0
21;Yeah, like I said, he's gotten a little... weirder. *Martan points at the dossier on his desk.* But it didn't affect his professionalism. And if it did, it was for the better.;;;
;Sarah…;22;;0
;Henry…;23;;0
;It'll be a pleasure getting back on my good old Aurora 2… When do I take off? And what am I to take care of first?;25;;0
22;*Martan coughs into his fist.* Sarah stayed on as Chief of Engineering at the Aurora 2. I think she knows more about the ship now than you do.;;;
;Gordon…;21;;0
;Henry…;23;;0
;It'll be a pleasure getting back on my good old Aurora 2… When do I take off? And what am I to take care of first?;25;;0
23;Yeah. To be honest, I was surprised he's still in service, he's pushing 70 now. But imagine that, he kept serving at the colony.;;;
;Wow. The conditions there are harsh.;24;;0
25;First, you need to get our ambassador to Unity. Joseph Chomsky... never heard of him, but they'd only send a professional, right? From Unity, go to the colony right away. When you're done there, get back. That's it. You're going as soon as we're done with the paperwork. A week or two. You can't leave the Aurora anymore, so I suggest you work on your physical shape. I think you're as used to being in space anymore.;;;
;Look again. It's like these five years never happened.;26;;0
24;And if the old man managed to stay in one piece there… Ha, he really is badass!;;;
;Gordon…;21;;0
;Sarah…;22;;0
;It'll be a pleasure getting back on my good old Aurora 2… When do I take off? And what am I to take care of first?;25;;0
26;Glad to hear that, buddy, glad to hear that. And now, allow me to… Remember these? *Martan goes into his drawer yet again and takes out...* They've gone cold, but…;;;
;Ntanda's cooking! I could do without seeing your mug for another ten years, but I've really missed these!;27;;0
27;*Martan looks at you with a slightly ironic expression.*;;;
;*crunch crunch crunch*;-1;;0
