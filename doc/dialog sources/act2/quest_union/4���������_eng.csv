0;*All the parties of the session take their seats (each one in their own part of the table, of course) and are waiting for something patiently. In a couple of seconds you realize what it was: onto the screen comes... a Gardener!* Hello to all of you... Mr Urilei. *The Zorsan ambassador nods grandly.* Mr Grorra. *The Bork... can you say he screws up his face? That's the only description you can give it.* Mr Firshe. *The Rogue smiles.* Glad to see you, of course, Fshiir. *The Klisk reacts with a series of excited clicks.* And you, Mr Right. As well as you, human captain. I'm pleased to know you are all here.;;;
;*what a piece of technology. You don't know where he is, but transmitting video even from the neighboring system…*;1;;0
1;You all know why I've gathered you here. With humans going out into open space, we've entered into a completely new age. Be it complicated or simple, we simply cannot go on living like we did before.;;;
;*looks like the Zorsan wants to say something*;2;;0
2;*the Zorsan ambassador interrupts the Guardian.* Simple?! These creatures took advantage of our hospitality! They attacked us! *The Guardian keeps silent, offering no comment for the Zorsan's words.*;;;
;*you have to whisper or it would be awkard* Joseph!;3;;0
3;*Joseph waits a few seconds and responds.* Of course, the relationship between Earth and Zorsan is tense, and we, from our side, are ready to do a lot to mend it. However, we are not going to admit our guilt. From our point of view, it was a provocation from the Zorsan side which targeted our representative personally. *Joseph nods your way.* And of course, he could say a lot about what really happened. And provide data. *The Zorsan ambassador's answer is short.* Lies! Fabricated data!;;;
;Lies?! We barely made it off your planet alive! You almost killed us!;4;zorsan_escape_victims == 0;0
;Lies?! We barely made it off your planet alive! We had casualties.;5;zorsan_escape_victims > 0;0
;I'm not going to lie.;6;;0
;*keep silent*;7;;0
4;*The Zorsan ambassador snorts angrily.* Lies! Are you trying to say you went through the best of our guards and didn't get a single scratch?! I knew you were dishonest creatures, but not that dishonest... You tried to kill our diplomatic representative sneakily, and then you ran away in shame! There were no confrontations with the guards!;;;
;*whisper* Joseph, shut that loudmouth up.;8;;0
5;*The Zorsan ambassador smiles smugly.* At least you know your limits when you lie. For your information: if you really had a run in with our military guards, you'd be dead.;;;
;I'm not going to argue with you. Joseph?;8;;0
6;But that's exactly what you're doing!;;;
;Joseph, have we come here to make a scene?;8;;0
7;Ha! *The Zorsan chortles.* Your lies won't let you speak up. You have nothing to say!;;;
;Won't let it go, that one… Joseph, say something?;8;;0
8;*Joseph raises his voice a little.* I repeat, we have recordings. And we have already provided them. *The Zorsan barely keeps from interrupting Joseph.* And we have our own evidence, too. Who?! Who are you going to trust?! Us, or... *Coming from him, it sounds very derisive.* ...or them?!;;;
;[NEXT];9;;0
9;And now, I'm asking you to keep silent. Yes, both of you have relevant evidence. Even if one of you is right... will it stop the war? *The Gardener shakes his hood silently.* The war goes on. And I'm not against that. War is a natural stage of development of any normal species, everything is going the way it goes. *Joseph is a little stunned. The Zorsan is, too. The others are silent, waiting for what happens next. Only the Klisk is clicking very quietly, satisfaction clearly audible in those sounds.* But now that you are at war, you have to go about it reasonably. With that goal I... Mr Fshiir?;;;
;[NEXT];10;;0
10;*The Klisk speaks up.* Yes... yes, gentlemen, of course.  We... we have prepared... *Joseph brushes your leg with his lightly and whispers something about how it's just what he thought it would be.* This is a treaty that will regulate your war with the Zorsan. The text is on your tablets already. *For the next few minutes, the Klisk reads the text of the treaty. He reads it quickly. You can follow it easily despite the really heavy political lawyer speak.* ...in other words, we could sum it up in several points. Point one: no weapons of mass destruction with irreparable damage. Point two: no genocide or inflicting civilian casualties on purpose. Point three: treating your enemy's cultural heritage objects with care. Point four:  @##%&&!&#& *The translator glitches on this word. Finally, it produces the closest counterpart.* ...humane treatment of your prisoners!;;;
;*whisper* Joseph… is that okay?;11;;0
11;*Joseph whispers in response.* This is what we had expected... Remember my words, Captain: they just want to regulate our war. They won't help either side until it's obvious which one is going to win. And then they'll enter the war to profit from it.;;;
;Disgusting.;12;;0
;Can't blame them.;13;;0
;But we've always had an okay relationship! And the Zorsan have had a war with everybody they could!;14;;0
12;This is politics, Captain… please, be quiet. Let's listen.;;;
;[NEXT];15;;0
13;I'm glad you understand. This is politics, my friend. It's never any different. Okay, keep quiet. He's reading something else.;;;
;[NEXT];15;;0
14;You're wonderfully naive, Captain. There is no place for good or bad relationships in politics. What is beneficial is what is beneficial for the state... Keep quiet, I think he's reading something else.;;;
;[NEXT];15;;0
15;*The Klisk really does keep reading the following points of the treaty: the other signatories are to keep their neutrality and are not to intervene until there is a violation of the treaty. All the aliens agree in unison. Joseph, who foresaw such a development, signs it as well. The Zorsan ambassador is a different case. He knows he doesn't have a choice and gives his signature. However, right after that, he leaves the session, clearly unhappy with the result. The Gardener speaks.* I am very sorry that Mr Urilei has demonstrated characteristic Zorsan arrogance... however, I'm glad the treaty has been accepted by all parties of this session. The next question is the Galactic Code. Modern international relationships need to be properly regulated. However, you are all different. It is difficult for you to understand each other, almost impossible... you all need to be united by a Galactic Code. A compendium of international laws that everyone traveling in your space must follow... I think it would be the best for all of you. I think... yes. I am glad you have listened to me. I am very glad... *The Gardener falls silent. The video feed is interrupted by a suddent flash, but then it continues.* Hello to all of you... Mr Urilei. Mr Grorra. Mr Firshe. Glad to see you, of course, Fshiir. And you, Mr Right. As well as you, human captain. I'm pleased to know you are all here.;;;
;Wait a second. It was a recording?;16;;0
16;*The Bork lets out an angry roar. His eyes are full of bad blood. You can see the table crack where he is grabbing it. Looks like he's insulted. The rest of the aliens aren't looking any better: they're confused, embarrassed. The Rogue ambassador actually looks scared: his expression is that of utter confusion. Joseph is talking to you.* Captain, what was that? You've talked to that creature before.;;;
;It wasn't a live feed Joseph, it was a recording. Somehow he knew what we would say, how we would say it, and recorded it all beforehand. But how?;17;;0
17;*Joseph shakes his head.* I don't know, Captain. I don't know. Please, let's get away. I want to get some rest from all this... *He eyes the session room. It's an utter bedlam. The ambassadors are talking to each other loudly, the Bork is waving his paws around and explaining something to the Klisk.*;;;
;You're right, we better leave.;18;;0
18;*It's as if you leave the core of a star, it's so chilly in the corridor. Joseph leans against a wall and wipes the sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief.* Looks like it'll be interesting working here. But hard, too. If one of those aliens can do THAT... what are the others capable of?;;;
;You saw them, Joseph. They're surprised and confused.;19;;0
19;All the worse. If that Gardener is something supernatural and mysterious even to them, who is he? *Joseph shakes his head. Major Okrarr comes out of the session room.* You came outside? I can understand that. It was sudden and... I can't decide whether I'm insulted or surprised. But let's leave it. Mr Joseph, you're tired. I'll give the order to show you to your apartment. Human captain, the ambassadors want to talk to you. All of them. Except the Zorsan one, obviously.;;;
;All at once?;20;;0
20;*The Bork laughs.* Of course not. And not now. In an hour, when they all come back to their workplace, be so kind as to visit them all. It's very important, human captain. It concerns several very delicate affairs... and the Obliterator.;;;
;The Obliterator? Oh. In that case, of course I'll come.;21;;0
21;*The Bork nods and leaves with Joseph. You're left alone. Only the ambassadors are making a ruckus in the session room, but you have no business there now. If you have an hour of free time, you better spend it resting.*;;;
;I wonder if they have something like a caf? here. Or a canteen.;-1;;0
