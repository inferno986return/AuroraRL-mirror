0;*You see a creature on a display. It matches the description in the report of the Aurora-1 commander. Indeed, the creature looks way too… human-like. The hat covers its sparkling eyes, whilst its cloak covers the rest of the body. It’s easy to mistake it for a human. It waits for you to speak.*;;Do… do you understand me?;11;*Its answers are brief and its voice sounds really unusual to a human ear.* Yes.;;Then on behalf of Earth and the entire humankind, the first human spaceship greets…;22;*It harrumphs and interrupts you.* You’re not the first. Three hundred seventy four earth days ago we met another spaceship that was similar to yours.;;What? The Aurora? Did you see the Aurora?;33;Yes, the Aurora it was called. It is a beautiful name. The Aurora. It is really enjoyable to pronounce it.;;Where is it? Where is the Aurora now? Do you know? Do you know the answer to this question?;44;*his speech sounds really weird even despite the fact that his grammar and stresses are alright* Sadly, we can’t give it to you.;;But why?;55;Because the Aurora has its own path and you have your own path.;;Please, tell me the location of the Aurora. Where is it? I… I beg you! Out planet needs that spaceship! It had a really, really important mission. Our entire planet depends on the Aurora.;66;We can't tell you. If you follow your path, you might meet the Aurora.;;Hell no! I don't know, what you mean, but I swear I'll shred you into small pieces, if you don't give me the information.;7;Okay, my path. If you use this phrase, apparently, it means something. What does it mean?;8;I agree with you and I'll follow my path. Perhaps, you're right. However, I don't completely understand you. What does «my path» mean?;97;*the creature shows no aggression* You're… unusual. The crew of the previous spaceship were unusual, too. They tried to threaten us, but then they were able to get our point.;;And I'm not able to do so! Do you still refuse to tell me the location of the Aurora?;10;But can't you understand that a lot of people might die, if we don't get the  information from the Aurora. There is a lot at stake! Our planet will highly appreciate your effort!;1110;Yes, you are right.;;In this case, you have only yourself to blame!;-111;You shouldn't follow someone else's path. In addition, we do know that your planet is useless to us. The Aurora gave us this information.;;I tried! Whoever you are, I must attack you, there is no other way to deal with the situation!;-1;It's really hard for me to admit, but okay, okay! What is this path you are talking about?;88;The path. We think that any creature has its own path. If a creature sees someone else's paths, it should never cross them. We do see such paths and we do not cross them.;;You… Who are you? What are you?;12;I don't understand what you're trying to say. What should I do to find the Aurora?;13;See… Cross… Are you trying to tell me that you can see the future?;1412;We are the Gardeners. I guess, this word can describe us, yes. Everything around you is the garden. It’s not ours, but we can seed the plants and watch them grow. I’m so sorry, but there is no way to explain it more detailed in your language.;;I don't understand what you're trying to say. What should I do to find the Aurora?;13;See… Cross… Are you trying to tell me that you can see the future?;1413;We've already told you, you should follow your path. If you are clever and strong, you'll find it and will follow it.;;You… Who are you? What are you?;12;See… Cross… Are you trying to tell me that you can see the future?;1414;That’s not quite right. We can’t explain it to you, because you will never understand it. Our perceptions are different. A plant will never become something else. Thus, if you see the seeds, you can easily predict its future: an apple kernel will never give life to a plum. There are almost no exceptions in this rule.;;I don't understand. You want me to follow my path. Okay. Great. You're right. But what does it mean?;9;You… Who are you? What are you?;12;I don't understand what you're trying to say. What should I do to find the Aurora?;139;Nothing. You have your path and you should follow it. We are not able to cross your path with the Aurora, but we can tell you something else.;;So I should follow it, right? Okay. That's even better. Over.;-1;Okay. What do you want to tell me?;1515;We do know that your race is not young anymore, that’s why you are here. We will be very glad to give you any help.;;And how do… Oh, yes, the Aurora… Okay. It is really great to hear something like that from the other race. How can you help us?;1616;We can give you a piece of advice. If the resources of your planet are exhousted, you should mine on the surface of other planets. The Universe is endless and it is constantly growing, so there is space for everybody.;;It is wondeful! Are there any other races in the Universe?;1717;Sure! Have you never dreamed about other civilizations in outer space?;;How can we reach out to them? We want to tell them about ourselves.;1818;Does it really worth it? *The gardener thinks for a while. He keeps silence for two minutes.*  Perhaps. There is a spacestation on the other side of this planet. The creatures there specialize on communication and trading. They will be happy to help you.;;And that's all?;2120;Yes, we've told you too much already.;;I thought that you REALLY want to help us.;2121;Just follow your path. Was this dialog just a waste of our time?;;I still don't understand you. But I don't think that the dialog was a waste of time. Over.;-1
