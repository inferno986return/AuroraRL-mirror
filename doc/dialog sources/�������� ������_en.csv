0;*Before you is a creature. It looks surprisingly human-like, and reminds you more of a fairy tale character than an alien. You can see it yourself, can't you? A pair of eyes glows in the darkness under its hat. Human eyes don't glow like that. It's time to turn on the device from the Aurora 1 and start talking.*;
;Can you understand me?;1
1;It is so. *The creature's voice is unusual, you can hear wooden sounds in it, strange rattling, clangs.* I… We… Gardener. Gardeners. Call us that.;
;We greet you. On behalf of Earth and all of humanity. We are humans. Our ship is the Aurora 2.;2
2;*Something that sounds like mocking.* I know who you are. A long time ago... one year ago. More. We saw a ship like yours. The Aurora 1. We gave them the ability to talk to everyone, and it was not in vain. You talk to me, and we understand each other.;
;Aurora 1? You came in contact with the Aurora 1?;3
3;It is so. Aurora… Aurora. Aurora. *laughter* I like saying this word. Aurora. Au-rora. Au. Ro. Ra.;
;In that case, I'll ask you a question. A very important one. Can you tell me where the Aurora 1 is right now?;4
4;I knew you would ask that. No. That is not in my power.;
;Why not?;5
5;The Aurora 1 has its own path, and you have yours.;
;I repeat, it is very important for all of my people.;6
6;We cannot. Different ships have different paths. But you can trust me... *The creature's eyes flash. No, it really does, it looks as if two flashlights got turned on in the dark gap below the hat.* You will definitely meet.;
;I am asking politely, but I could use force.;7
;Paths. Why are you talking about roads? What do you mean?;8
;Okay. I don't have time for this, anyway. If you contacted the Aurora 1, you probably know why humans have gone out to outer space.;9
7;Oh. Humans. Maybe you are all like that. *The Gardener's eyes flash, but it doesn't stop there. Suddenly, the ship's alarm goes off. Synthesized voice informs you that external defense systems have been deactivated.* See? *After that the alarm quiets down. Sarah instantly hails you on the second line.*;
;Sarah?;99
8;Paths. Lots of them. We are all changed by the paths we choose... You don't want to accidentally change after setting out down someone else's road, do you? It is what makes us different. We are perfectly aware of the borders between our paths and the others'.;
;Who are you?;12
;I don't understand. What do you want to tell me? What do I do to find the Aurora?!;13
12;*laughter* I told you… We are Gardeners. Look around. Is it not beautiful? It is the Garden. It is not ours. Nor is it yours. It... *He stutters. It looks weird.* We just tend to it. And we can see what will happen to the plants.;
;Hard to understand. Just tell me what to do to find the Aurora 1.;13
;You can see what will happen to them? Are you trying to say that you can see the future?;14
13;He who is strong and intelligent will find the path. Or he will lay it.;
;Who are you?;12
;Path? Is it me or do you mean… the future?;14
14;There is no future. Everything moves back and forth, in circles. You will understand this, but not now. But you will.;
;Okay. Right. You want us to follow our own path. But you can't point us to it.;6
;Who are you?;12
;I don't understand. What do you want to tell me? What do I do to find the Aurora?!;13
9;Yes. You are the people of a dying planet. You need contact. You need help. You need resources.;
;Can you help us with that?;18
18;Resources? *laughs* Look around… and take them from wherever you want. This Garden is endless, and it is getting bigger every second. You do not need our help. You need the Klisks.;
;Who?;19
19;Klisks. Their station is here. Look for it. That will be what starts it all.;
;I don't understand. What will it start?;20
20;*The Gardener's eyes flash.* Back and forth, and then in circles… You will understand. Until next time, human captain. It will not be soon.;
;Wait!;21
21;*It's no use. He disconnected.*;
;Damn. That was… weird. First contact is first contact.;-1
99;Captain… *She's embarrassed.* Some… Some kind of bug in the system! All the shields went down in a second! Even radar defense! It's back up, but... I'll sort it out, Cap. I'll find out what caused it.;
;Of course. *Henry is trying to contact you.*;98
98;Captain. *His voice is dry, but you can see that Henry is nervous.* Weapon systems are down. It's like the energy just disappeared. We're feeding them again, but it's not going very fast.;
;I see. Go on. Report if this happens again..;97
97;*Henry nods and disappears from the screen. You go back to the Gardener.*;
