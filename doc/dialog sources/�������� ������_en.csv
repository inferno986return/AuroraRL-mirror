0;*You see a creature on a display. It matches the description in the report of the Aurora-1 commander. Indeed, the creature looks way too... human-like. The hat covers its sparkling eyes, whilst its cloak covers the rest of the body. It's easy to mistake it for a human. It waits for you to speak.*;
;Do... do you understand me?;1
1;*Its answers are brief and its voice sounds really unusual to a human ear.* Yes.;
;Then on behalf of Earth and the entire humankind, the first human spaceship greets...;2
2;*It harrumphs and interrupts you.* You're not the first. Three hundred seventy four earth days ago we met another spaceship that was similar to yours.;
;What? The Aurora? Did you see the Aurora?;3
3;Yes, the Aurora it was called. It is a beautiful name. The Aurora. It is really enjoyable to pronounce it.;
;Where is it? Where is the Aurora now? Do you know? Do you know the answer to this question?;4
4;*his speech sounds really weird even despite the fact that his grammar and stresses are alright* I knew you would ask. But I can not tell you.;
;But why?;5
5;Because the Aurora has its own path and you have your own path.;
;Please, tell me the location of the Aurora. Where is it? Our entire planet depends on the Aurora.;6
6;We can't tell you. If you follow your path, you might meet the Aurora.;
;Hell no! I don't know, what you mean, but I swear I'll shred you into small pieces, if you don't give me the information.;7
;Okay, my path. If you use this phrase, apparently, it means something. What does it mean?;8
;Ok. Anyway I do not have time for this. Do you know why did we have to send these deep space research ships?;9
7;*the creature shows no aggression* Humans… You must all be the same. *The gardeners eyes flash. Suddenly the alarm sounds and the computer voice informs about all weapon system critical malfunction. You receive an incoming call from Sarah*;
;Sarah?;99
8;Paths. There are plenty of them. And we all get changed by the ones we choose. You do not want to change by stepping on a wrong road, don't you?;
;Who are you?;12
;I do not understand. What do you mean? How can I find Aurora?;13
12;*Short laughter*I have already told you… We are the Gardeners. Look around, isn't it beautiful here? This is the garden. It does not belong to us. It... *he suddenly stumples* we just look after it. And we see what will happen with the plants.;
;Its hard to understand you. Just tell me what should I do to find Aurora;13
;You see what happens… Do you see the future?;14
13;The smart can find the way, the strong can make its own.;
;Who are you?;12
;The way? Do you mean the future?;14
14;There is no future. Everything moves in circles. You will understand it but not right now. But you will.;
;So you want us to follow our own path but you will not show it to us. Right?;6
;Who are you?;12
;I do not understand. What do you mean? How can I find Aurora?;6
9;You live on a dying planet. You need a contact. Help. Resources.;
;Can you help us with that?;18
18;Resources? *he laughs* Look around… and take whatever you want. This garden is endless. You do not need the help, but you may need the Klisk.;
;What?;19
19;The Klisk. Their station is located in this system. Check it. Everything begins here.;
;"I do not understand. What ""begins""?";20
20;There and back again in circles. You will understand. Farewell, human captain. We will meet again.;
;Wait!;21
21;*Link terminated*;
;Damn it was strange. But what else should you expect from an alien?;-1
99;Captain… *she is confused* There.. There is some kind of malfunction here. All defences went down for a couple of seconds! Now everything is working again. I will try to find the cause.;engineer_dialog
;I see *Henry is also calling*;98
98;Captain. The weapon systems are offline. We are rebooting and reloading now but it will take some time.;marine_dialog
;I see. Go on. Report immediately if it happens again.;97
97;Henry nods and disconnects. You switch back to the alien.;
;…;6
