0;Oh… Human captain. What brings you here?;;;;
;We have to talk about something.;27;reputation > 6;;
;About those klisk mutants…;-1;heritage.quest_started && !heritage.quest_completed;129;
;We have to talk about something.;16;reputation < 7;;
;We wish to trade;-1;;100;
;I'm back. The trade fleet is safe and sound.;1;klisk_trade.result;;
;A courtesy visit. I see you're busy. I'm leaving already.;-1;;;
1;*Eroloa coughs loudly.* Kahha! I'm waiting for details.;;;;
;Everything is good. Apart from the fact that the captain of the main transport ship suddenly got sick, and that almost sabotaged the deal.;2;;;
2;So how did you sort it out, human captain?;;;;
;I didn't. I don't like putting my nose where it doesn't belong, so I just guarded the cargo until Dlorou got better. That is why we're late.;3;klisk_trade.result=refused;;
;Well… I allowed myself to carry out the deal. Is that a bad thing?;13;klisk_trade.result!=refused;;
3;"Kahha! *Eroloa clicks approvingly.* Some will call your decision stupid… But the Code says ""Do not touch the mechanism you did not calibrate."" You did well, Captain.";;;;
;I think so, too.;27;;;
13;*Eroloa tenses up suddenly, but he's in control of himself.* Right… Now that's interesting. So tell me, human captain, how did you do it?;;;;
;Well, I tried not to bite more than I could chew. I traded it all for money without trying to get fancy with the exchange.;24;klisk_trade.result=good;;
;I did it according to the Code. I think I did it right.;25;klisk_trade.result=perfect;;
;I made a profitable deal, Mr Eroloa.;14;klisk_trade.result=bad;;
14;*Eroloa reads your cargo manifest and his color changes very noticeably. Then he starts clicking rapidly and irritatedly.* Human captain... Do you understand that you... *He grunts quietly and gets angry.* You... You ruined it all.;;;;
;But I exchanged your goods and made a profit! What's so bad about it?;15;;;
15;Captain... We're bound by the Code. It says that exchanging things for themselves isn't stupid. All our deals are of great scale, they have multiple stages and are systematic. And you ruined one of those great systems... *Eroloa sighs.* You brought us a small, here-and-now profit, but you deprived us of potentially incredible gains. Congratulations.;;;;
;I'm very sorry.;16;;;
16;What do you want?;;;;
;No, I've already discussed everything I wanted to discuss. It's time for me to go.;-1;;;
;Yeah, there is something. Recently, a trade bot has come to my planet's orbit, and it's ruining all of our communications. I found out that it was owned by the Hakazar Company. I don't know who else I can talk to. Can you help me?;17;klisk_trader_drone.communicated ;;
;There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. It won't happen today or tomorrow, we have almost two years... but still. We are at completely different stages of development. My planet needs help, or we will lose.;20;zorsan.war_preparations;;
17;Oh. Too bad… Kahha! Too bad… I cannot help you. *You can see great pain in Eroloa's face.* I am an official employee of the Vortangu Company. I am not allowed to meddle with Hakazar's affairs.;;;;
;So what do I do?;18;;;
18;Try to buy what he's selling, he'll leave then.;;;;
;Hm.;19;;;
19;Was there anything else?;;;;
;There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. It won't happen today or tomorrow, we have almost two years... but still. We are at completely different stages of development. My planet needs help, or we will lose.;20;zorsan.war_preparations;;
;No, we've already discussed everything I wanted to discuss. It's time for me to go.;-1;;;
20;*Eroloa thinks for a while. He empties his glass in one swig and coughs for a long time.*;;;;
;….;21;;;
21;*He is still coughing.*;;;;
;Do you need any help?;22;;;
22;*He shakes his head no and coughs.* No. I'm not talking about helping me… Kahha! Although I'll say no to that, too. We cannot help you, human captain. I'm sorry.;;;;
;But we really need something. After they're done with us, the Zorsan might go to you next.;23;;;
;That's too bad. In that case, I'm leaving you.;-1;;;
23;*Eroloa smiles.* They won't. Captain, don't waste my time.;;;;
;That's too bad. In that case, I'm leaving you.;-1;;;
24;*Eroloa reads the cargo manifest attentively, then puts it aside, clicking with relief.* You were already getting me worried... but you did the right thing for a foreigner. It's not ideal, but we got off easy enough.;;;;
;Too bad I made a mistake somewhere.;3;;;
25;*Eroloa reads the cargo manifest. He clicks in surprise.* Human captain, I couldn't have done the deal better myself…;;;;
;Is that a compliment?;26;;;
26;Absolutely. You… Kahha! You handled yourself very well. Was it luck or a well-calculated plan? Doesn't matter. I'm happy it turned out like this.;;;;
;I'm happy, too. You know, I have a few things I want to discuss with you.;27;;;
27;*Eroloa listens attentively.*;;;;
;The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. We have almost two years, which gives us a chance… but we won't be able to repel their attack alone. We could use some help.;28;zorsan.war_preparations && !klisk.war_help;;
;A Hakazar Company merchant bot has set up camp on the orbit of my planet. It's giving us trouble. Could you help us make them recall it?  ;34;klisk_trader_drone.communicated ;;
;No, nothing, no business. It has been good working with you, even though a bit tiring. I have to go.;-1;;;
28;The Zorsan? *Eroloa clicks nervously.* I'm not surprised, but how did you let that happen? You know what… don't tell me. It's a bad situation.;;;;
;And what is your decision?;29;;;
29;I'm considering it... Kahha! I can't send you any troops. It'll be considered an intervention, and the Klisks are always neutral. I can't send you our newest weapons, since I can't do it for free. The Code forbids it. But... *Eroloa crawls over to the phone and makes a call.* Yes. This is Eroloa. Connect me with the Department of Recycling.;;;;
;….;30;;;
30;Department of Recycling? Eroloa. Glad to hear you. *He grunts.* As far as I know, the obsolete battleship weapon systems haven't been destroyed yet. They haven't? Great. Ready them for transportation. The most powerful ones. Thank you. *He hangs up.* There you go.;;;;
;Obsolete weapons? How generous. Am I supposed to thank you?;31;;;
31;*Eroloa shakes his head.* It's obsolete by our standards... Kahha! Ahem. And secondly, they're battleship systems, they're very powerful. You could use them to organize fixed-site protection. And the third thing is, the Code doesn't forbid gifting things you yourself don't need. The fourth thing is, if you don't need them, you don't have to take them.;;;;
;I'll do just that. Thank you, but I don't need your trash.;32;;;
;I think your help is better than nothing.;33;;;klisk.war_help
32;Your call. Is there anything else?;;;;
;No, nothing, no business. It has been good working with you, even though a bit tiring. I have to go.;-1;;;
;A Hakazar Company merchant bot has set up camp on the orbit of my planet. It's giving us trouble. Could you help us make them recall it?  ;34;klisk_trader_drone.communicated ;;
33;Good, then. The systems will be delivered to your ship. Was there anything else?;;;;
;No, nothing, no business. It has been good working with you, even though a bit tiring. I have to go.;-1;;;
;A Hakazar Company merchant bot has set up camp on the orbit of my planet. It's giving us trouble. Could you help us make them recall it?  ;34;klisk_trader_drone.communicated ;;
34;Hakazar.. *Eroloa shakes his hand and clicks quietly.* Normally, I'd say no. Hakazar is a very powerful company, ranked higher than Vortang. But, now... I'll try to help you. Of course. But I want to ask you, is that really necessary? It won't be very easy for me. Are you sure there isn't a simpler solution to your problem?;;;;
;Hm… I changed my mind. I better sort it out myself. But remember, you owe me one.;36;;;
;Alas, there is no choice.;35;;;klisk_trader_drone.withdraw
35;Good. The bot will leave your orbit soon and won't come back. Is there anything else?;;;;
;My business is done. I have to go.;-1;;;
36;Of course. *Eroloa clicks affirmatively.* Having a Klisk like me in your debt… Captain, that's an enviable position. Is there anything else?;;;;
;No, nothing. I don't have any more business. I have to go.;-1;;;
