0;*You walk inside. The office is very yellow, and the floor is very sticky and crunchy. It's because it's covered with sand, and the walls of the office are painted yellow. The Klisk diplomatic representative, Mr Eroloa, is at the opposite wall of the office. He's looking out of the window, almost completely blocking it from view with his enormous body.* Human captain... Kahha. Pleased to meet you.;;;
;The pleasure is mine.;1;;
1;Try not to get distracted by my abode. I know, it must look strange to you... *The Klisk crawls away from the window, leaving a trace of wet sand behind him.* Our planet... it's very hot. Also, sand. There is a lot of sand. It's easy to move on it.;;;
;I understand. I've been told you're serious about tradition.;2;;
2;Right... *He crawls over to something that looks like a table, closer to you, and you get an opportunity to get a better look at him. Eroloa is very old, which is obvious even to someone who isn't used to Klisks. His sides are pulsing slightly, his antennae are shuddering, and his skin tone is an unpleasent brownish green.* I'll pour myself a drink, excuse me. *Eroloa gets closer to the cupboard and takes out a pitcher and a glass. When he crawls back to the table, his glass is already full.* I'm old, Mr Human Captain. I can allow myself a little faux pas. There are chairs next to the wall. Grab one and take a seat. You will excuse me if I don't offer you a drink, I doubt you'll have it.;;;
;….;3;;
3;*While you're taking a chair, Eroloa is distracted by a quiet beeping from a small box. Obviously, it is some kind of communication device.* Yes, it's me. What? He never got here? Well, find a replacement. There isn't one? Hm... I'll think about it. I'm busy. *Eroloa hangs up and turns the little box off.* I see you're seated already. Let's get right to business, I don't like all this... *He waves his hand.*;;;
;Okay. We're humans, from planet Earth, Earthlings. I represent my people. We want diplomatic cooperation with the Klisks.;4;;
4;Kahha… *Eroloa drinks.* And how does it benefit the Klisks?;;;
;Have you received the information package?;5;;
5;I've read it… But why don't you tell me yourself?;;;
;I'll try. Even if it doesn't happen right away, cooperation will benefit both of us. For example, cultural exchange. You're more technologically advanced, but the gap isn't unbreachable.;12;;
;Hm. And what does the Code say about it?;6;klisk.klisk_info;
6;Kahha! You're familiar with the Code?;;;
;Not exactly. I allowed myself to learn a little about the Klisks before coming here.;7;;
7;That was a good decision. You can't even imagine how good. The Code says that you have to befriend those seeking friendship and those offering friendship in return. You have to respect those whose friendship gives you profit. And you have to love those who really give you both friendship and profit. The Klisks cooperate with everybody who is not hostile. The Borks, despite the sixty percent factor. The Rogues, despite their Obliterator fanaticism. We would be friends with the Zorsan, but they don't want it themselves. *Eroloa stops talking to take a sip from the glass. It is a perfect time to ask him a question.*;;;
;The Bork factor?;8;;
;The Rogues' fanaticism? What's the Obliterator?;9;;
;What, are the Zorsan really that hostile?;10;;
;*wait for Eroloa to take a sip*;11;;
8;Yes… Or didn't you know? Sixty percent of Borks are complete imbeciles. It's their genetic peculiarity.;;;
;The Rogues' fanaticism? What's the Obliterator?;9;;
;What, are the Zorsan really that hostile?;10;;
;Well, then, are you going to cooperate with us?;11;;
9;You don't know what the Obliterator is? Well, you'll find out. The Rogues are very religious about it… kahha!;;;
;The Bork factor?;8;;
;What, are the Zorsan really that hostile?;10;;
;Well, then, are you going to cooperate with us?;11;;
10;Not hostile. Arrogant.;;;
;The Bork factor?;8;;
;The Rogues' fanaticism? What's the Obliterator?;9;;
;Well, then, are you going to cooperate with us?;11;;
11;*Eroloa wipes his lips* Cooperate… hm… well, we'll be friends for starters. And then... Kahha! Then is then. *The phone rings again. Eroloa turns toward it, picks up the receiver and listens attentively.*;;;
;….;24;;
12;It's all empty words, do you understand? And we're talking seriously here... I need to know what you can give us, so that we can see what we give you. These are the laws of trade and profit, human captain. *Eroloa waves his trembling hand.*;;;
;You want more information?;13;;
13;It could help you. Kh… *Eroloa stops coughing and suddenly looks at you very seriously.* Hurry up with your answer, Captain. It all depends on you. I would say that the fate of the relationship between our planets is in your hands.;;;
;Hm. Mr Eroloa. I get it, but I'm not authorized to divulge any information apart from what is said in the package.;14;;
;Okay. I could tell you some things I know personally. I hope it is enough.;18;;
;I could request information from the ship's database. I need a secure line.;21;;
14;Are you sure about your decision? Do you understand you can ruin it all?;;;
;Yes. I'm sorry, but my instructions are clear.;15;;
;No. In fact… Tell me exactly what you need.;98;;
98;More information. Hurry up with your answer, Captain. It all depends on you. I would say that the fate of the relationship between our planets is in your hands.;;;
;And still, I can't. I cannot tell you any more.;14;;
;Okay. I could tell you some things I know personally. I hope it is enough.;18;;
;I could request information from the ship's database. I need a secure line.;21;;
15;Hm… Well, then. Human captain! *Eroloa crawls back a little.*;;;
;….;16;;
16;I don't know whether our cooperation will be productive, but you know how to keep secrets. Congratulations.;;;
;What, was it all a prank?;17;;
17;Kahha! *Eroloa drinks from the glass again. He crawls away to pour some more and comes back.* Let's give it a more serious name: a battle test. You passed it. According to the Code, Captain, I cannot decline your proposal. The Code says that he who proposes friendship wins twice. And he who accepts it, thrice.;;;
;It's good. I'm glad we can cooperate.;11;;
18;Of course it is… *Eroloa smiles encouragingly.* I'm ready to listen to you.;;;
;I think… I'm not going to rush it. What exactly do you need?;98;;
;….;19;;
19;*The Klisk listens to your disconnected tale, sometimes coughing or watering his throat. Is five minutes a long time? And what if it's filled with information?* I understand you, human captain. I don't think it's going to be something grand... but cooperation with you does make sense.;;;
;Is this a yes?;20;;
20;Of course. You have to be proud of having done it all by yourself.;;;
;I'm proud. I'm glad that we'll be cooperating.;11;;
21;You'll get it.;;;
;….;22;;
22;*And you do. In just a few minutes, the Aurora sends over the package of information that Eroloa needs. You shudder to imagine how much data it contains. Eroloa glances over it, only reading the most important parts, but even that takes forty minutes, during which you burrow a small hole in the chair with your ass.* Hm... Kahha! Yeah... Well, then. *Eroloa smiles, exceptionally happy with himself.* Cooperation definitely makes sense. We'll do great things together. Especially if people like you represent Earth.;;;
;Are you making fun of me or is that a yes?;23;;
23;Nonsense! You have to be proud of yourself! You've gotten impressive… Kahha! Results!;;;
;In that case, I'm glad that we'll be cooperating from now on.;11;;
24;Yes. No. Yes. I told you to find one! What? I can't hear- *With a surprising grace for someone his size, Eroloa turns around and looks at you. He shouts into the receiver.* Call back in... Kahha! Ten minutes. *He puts the receiver back.* Human captain, I have a proposition for you.;;;
;I'm listening.;25;;
25;*Eroloa takes a sip from the glass.* We have a little problem. A small trading fleet that was supposed to take off an hour ago is unguarded. *He frowns.* The stupid escort Bork got into a fight on the way here, and ended up in the atmosphere of some planet while on a super-heavy cruiser... The cruiser and the Bork are no more.;;;
;You want me to escort the fleet? The Aurora is no super-heavy cruiser, Mr Eroloa.;26;;
26;It doesn't matter. The chances of an attack are very small. Do you agree? You could say no… Kahha! I'm not obliging you.;;;
;I'm very busy with other things, Mr Eroloa. I have to decline your proposition.;27;;
;No, of course not. I'll help you.;35;;
27;Oh, of course. Who am I to make you do it? *Eroloa makes a call.* Find it yourselves. Yes. *He hangs up.* I think we're done, human captain. Was there anything else? Don't hesitate to ask.;;;
;No, we've discussed everything we had to discuss. It's time for me to go.;-1;;
;Yeah, there is something. Recently, a trade bot has come to my planet's orbit, and it's ruining all of our communications. I found out that it was owned by the Hakazar Company. I don't know who else I can talk to. Can you help me?;28;klisk_trader_drone.communicated;
;There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. It won't happen today or tomorrow, we have almost two years... but still. We are at completely different stages of development. My planet needs help, or we will lose.;31;zorsan.war_preparations;
28;Oh. Too bad… Kahha! Too bad… I cannot help you. *You can see great pain in Eroloa's face.* I am an official employee of the Vortangu Company. I am not allowed to meddle with Hakazar affairs.;;;
;So what do I do?;29;;
29;You know what? *Eroloa waves his hand.* I'll try to help you. It won't be easy, but… *he smiles* Come see me in a month.;;;
;Oh, of course. Thank you.;30;;
30;Was there anything else?;;;
;There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. It won't happen today or tomorrow, we have almost two years... but still. We are at completely different stages of development. My planet needs help, or we will lose.;31;zorsan.war_preparations;
;No, we've discussed everything we had to discuss. It's time for me to go.;-1;;
31;*Eroloa thinks for a while. He empties his glass in one swig and coughs for a long time.*;;;
;…;32;;
32;*He is still coughing.*;;;
;Do you need any help?;33;;
33;*He shakes his head no and coughs.* No. I'm not talking about helping me… Kahha! Although I'll say no to that, too. We cannot help you, human captain. I'm sorry.;;;
;But we really need something. After they're done with us, the Zorsan might go to you next.;34;;
;That's too bad. In that case, I'm leaving you.;-1;;
34;*Eroloa smiles.* They won't. Captain, don't waste my time.;;;
;That's too bad. In that case, I'm leaving you.;-1;;
35;That is wonderful. In that case... excuse me... *Eroloa turns towards the phone again.* Gentlemen, I've found you a guard. Not, he's smart. Not a Bork. No, not a Rogue. Human. Kahha! From Earth. Kahha! I don't care. The Code says... *He gets a fervent speech in response. He waits patiently.* Your proposition is accepted, but we don't have a choice. Wait for the new guard. Thank you.;;;
;What is the actual mission? Just escort the trade fleet?;36;;
36;Exactly. Just escort the trade fleet there and back. It's an easy job. Kahha!;;;
;If it's so easy, why do you need me?;37;;
37;The fleet has to be guarded.;;;
;Right. So… where do I go now?;38;;
38;Your escort will take you there. Kahha! I'm glad that you've decided to help us.;;;
;….;-1;;1
