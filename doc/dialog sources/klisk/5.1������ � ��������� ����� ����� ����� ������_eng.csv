0;*You get a call. Something from the Klisk flagship.*;;;
;I read you, go ahead.;1;;
1;Hello. Mr Dlorou Harten proposes we dock our ships and dine together before getting to the destination.;;;
;What, is it that necessary? Why waste time if it's easier and more comfortable to do it at the station?;2;;
2;*The call goes to a different line.* Ahem... *Dlorou grunts and wheezes.* It's a symbol of respect, Captain. I don't want to push it on you, it's your call. It really would be easier and more comfortable at the station, but here... we're in space. We'll make the crews happy and all.;;;
;All right. I'll give the order to start docking. Get the tables and the drinks ready. ;-1;;1
;I propose we make the crews twice as happy, but at the station. Why waste time?;3;;
3;You're definitely right. Over and out.;;;
;….;-1;;
