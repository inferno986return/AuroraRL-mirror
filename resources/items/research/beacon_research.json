        "text" : "This structure is located near the sun, consuming its energy and transforming it into emiision of different types of waves, both radio and hyperwave. It is transmitting a small, repeatable pattern, and its power is enormous. We believe it can be easily detected even with our low-resolution sensors from more than a thousand light years. Due to these points we believe that this structure is some kind of a beacon, perhaps used for navigation, or for marking places of interest for its creators. \n
                                   We din't fully understand mechanincs of its emission and energy consumption, but it overpowers all technology available to humanity. Detailed study of
                                   collected data in Earth laboratories can lead to a breakthrough in high-energy and hyperwave physics.

                   We should also be careful, as creators of this beacon may not welcome our violation of their territory."
