                                  The last record was mentioning that they had searched stars nearby and found nothing interesting, and they were planning to make a long jump to sector
                                  after [50, 10] and explore that part of space. \n
                                  In addition probe storage contained some ship log messages and a backup copy of work done by Aurora science team. There is nothing really valuable for us there,
                                  but it will be useful for researches on Earth."
