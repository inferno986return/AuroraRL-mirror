enterprise_1.name=At last
enterprise_1.desc=Hello! \n\
My stay on Earth is finally over, they have finally finished building my ship and we are leaving in a couple of days. So don't think you’ll be ahead of your teacher anymore. And guess how they named her? The Enterprise, like in that old movie, heh. \n\
So now we are joining you in your search. Looking forward to meeting you in outer space, cowboy. \n\
Derek McCartney, captain of UNS Enterprise, can't stop laughing at that name.

enterprise_launch.name=Project Aurora news: New Ship Launched
enterprise_launch.desc=A new ship Project Aurora ship has successfully been launched this Friday. It will explore a new sector of galaxy near the Orion star system. Its main objective is establishing diplomatic contacts with alien species in the region. \n\
The ship is called UNS Enterprise, based on hundreds of thousands pleas received from Star Trek fans. It is the third ship of the series, capable of housing up to a thousand crew members, scientists and explorers. \n\
Its return is scheduled for Autumn of the next year.

icarus_0.name=Breakthrough in Solar Power Use?
icarus_0.desc=According to the data from the official Project Aurora news, one of its ships has brought highly valuable data concerning the use of solar energy from its expedition. \n\
Data and technology acquired from an alien beacon-like structure can lead to a creation of much more effective ways of collecting and transferring solar power, which could give humanity the ‘free energy’ it has coveted for so long. Scientists at Earth laboratories are now carefully studying retrieved material and are preparing an official statement

icarus_1.name=Good Work
icarus_1.sender=A. V. Buren, Aurora CEO
icarus_1.desc=Greetings.\n\
Perhaps you have already heard about Project Icarus? A few more years and the Earth energy crisis will be over once and for all. And this is done thanks to your effort. Good job, captain!


icarus_2.name=Free Energy Tomorrow?
icarus_2.desc=The world’s scientific society is shocked by the discoveries made by analyzing materials retrieved from an alien beacon by a Project Aurora ship, as they disprove all that we knew about using solar energy. New discoveries have lead to the creation of new cheap ways of extracting power from the Sun. \n\
As Earth energy reserves are nearly depleted, scientists use this new knowledge to present a solution: Project Icarus, a series of energy consuming space stations surrounding the Sun.\n\
The construction of the first station has already started.

icarus_3.name=First Icarus Station Launched
icarus_3.desc=The world is holding its breath while watching how the first gigawatt of energy is transferred from the Icarus 1 station to Earth. Though the launch of the station was delayed several times, it has finally been launched, and is producing power for the needs of Earth. \n\
Experts predict energy prices dropping by 15% by the end of the year, and the special power regulation laws in some of the most populated Earth regions being cancelled.

icarus_4.name=Energy Crisis Over, Labor Crisis Incoming?
icarus_4.desc=For the last few months after the Icarus power station has reached its full productivity, troubling news have been coming from UN power plants and factories. Cheap solar energy has rendered these structures obsolete. While the ecologists and the general population praise Project Icarus, power tycoons and workers hate it and are trying to sabotage the construction of new stations. \n\
Many workers in the energy production sector have lost their jobs. Strikes and uprisings took place in Russia, Egypt and European countries, which makes future of Icarus project unclear.
obliterator_discovered.name=Greatest Known Artificial Structure Discovered
obliterator_discovered.desc=UNS ship has encountered the biggest artificial structure ever seen by Man in a distant star system. A huge object of unknown origin, larger than a star, can be seen on these amazing photos. Who created it? What is its purpose? What power does it have? Read more in the next issue of 'Galaxy News'.

evac_start.name=Colonization Begins!
evac_start.desc=UN government together with Project Aurora officials has made a long-expected announcement. Finally humanity begins interstellar colonization! \n\
Currently, everyone can make a request to enter the colonization program. Of course, preference is given to those who have good health and expertise, suitable for the needs of the new colony. \n\
A colonization plan has been drafted for the next 10 years, and new interstellar ships are being constructed entirely for its purposes. The first colony ship is to take off shortly.

evac_start_2.name=Form #312-b [TOP SECRET]
evac_start_2.sender=Evacuation committee
evac_start_2.desc=As a high-ranking Project Aurora officer, you are permitted to select 2 people that will be taken to a new colony. They are guaranteed a place on the evacuation ship. \n\
They must be no older than 45 years, be your first-order relatives (including wife and children), and pass a medical test. Please, fill out the attached form and submit it to the Aurora Special Operations Desk. \n\
Remember, the number of people we can save is heavily limited, so choose wisely. If you do not have any relatives you personally want to save, report this as soon as possible.

press_conference_1.name=Project Aurora News
press_conference_1.desc=The most significant news of the last few days is the return of the Aurora 2, the second ship created by Project Aurora. As you may remember, the first one disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and there are no updates about it at the moment.\n\
Right after returning to Earth, the captain of the Aurora 2 attended a press conference where he answered some of the hottest-burning questions. The captain made it clear that he was not of the meek sort, and that space that had welcomed him with vast new territories was not going to stay unexplored for long. Not even meeting other intelligent species is going to get in the way of that: despite the fact that the mission of the Aurora 2 is a peaceful one, its crew is ready to use force without hesitation should the need arise. But that does not mean that there will be no cooperation with the aliens: in fact, the opposite is true, even though they are foreign. And what about their mission objective? The captain said with certainty that we are very close to having a normal life again.\n\
In the end, when answering the question concerning the search for the missing Aurora 1, the captain noted that there are more pressing matters, mentioning “saving the planet.” Does it sound histrionic? Yes. But we can understand where he is coming from.

press_conference_2.desc=The most significant news of the last few days is the return of the Aurora 2, the second ship created by Project Aurora. As you may remember, the first one disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and there are no updates about it at the moment.\n\
Right after returning to Earth, the captain of the Aurora 2 attended a press conference where he answered some of the hottest-burning questions. The captain made it clear that, despite the gravity of the mission, he is very professional in what he does. He reacted in the same vein to a certain immodest female reporter, which reveals him as a cold professional. When talking about interplanetary cooperation, he stated that such diplomatic connections will be established shortly, and they may turn out to be long-term. The captain did not go into specifics when talking about his mission objective, confining himself to vague hints at possible success of the voyage.\n\
When answering a question about looking for the Aurora 1, the captain stated that the search is underway, but its priority was not as high on the list as the main objective of the Aurora 2.

press_conference_3.desc=The most significant news of the last few days is the return of the Aurora 2, the second ship created by Project Aurora. As you may remember, the first one disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and there are no updates about it at the moment.\n\
Right after returning to Earth, the captain of the Aurora 2 attended a press conference where he answered some of the hottest-burning questions. It became clear that for the captain of the Aurora 2, space is something beautiful and novel, with a hint of romance, which reveals him as someone who is truly in love with his job. He is just as excited about interplanetary contact, which is a good thing for a modern pioneer of deep space. He also remarked that such contact (in any shape or form) is very important for humanity, and work is already being done about it having a favorable image. What does raise concern is the crisis question: the captain not only declined to give a clear answer, but it could also be seen from the way he looked that the Aurora 2 was not doing great.\n\
Concluding the press conference with some information about the search for the Aurora 1, the captain assured us that its trail had already been found and the search was bound to be a success, thus giving hope to the families left behind by the ship’s numerous crew members.

zorsan_attack_1.name=A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH
zorsan_attack_1.desc=A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ASIAN UNION, EUROPEAN ALLIANCE, AND THE AMERICAN ALLIANCE.\n\
 Humans. Yes, humans, because we grew out of internal intrigue and conflict a long time ago. We are now in the Space Age, the Age of New Discoveries. The Age of Unity.\n\
Unfortunately, it just so happened that as soon as we went to space, we gained a new enemy. An enemy who is dangerous, strong, and who has already declared war on us. The kind of war we are not acquainted with: war in space.\n\
Our enemy was drawn in by our inexperience and apparent defenselessness. But when they come here, they will know what humans are really like. The enemy will be crushed. Victory will be ours. We will have peace once again.\n\
Because of all this, from now on temporary martial law is declared across all of Earth.\n\
New rules and regulations will be transmitted daily using local television channels, newspapers, and flyers. Follow them and pay attention to the announcements of local civil protection and defense forces.\n\
\n\
AN ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH FROM POPE GREGORY XVII\n\
Pope Gregory XVII, in his address to the people of Earth, called for avoidance of malice and showing the enemy more mercy. “Be humane,” said the Pope, “because even though we are enemies, that much is temporary, but peace is forever.”\n\
The Pope’s message was approved by the Patriarch of Moscow and All Rus Adrian and Khalif Ibrahim Abd Abu al-Hair. Dalai Lama Gyaltsen refused to comment, citing the need for neutrality in such questions.

zorsan_attack_2.name=Quotes From the Internet
zorsan_attack_2.desc=”Guys, I have a question. So I was looking at the night sky through a telescope. It’s been shining weirdly lately, you know? Kind of interesting. So I was looking at it, right, and BAM! A flash! And I got blinded. First question: where do I get shaded lenses? Second question: I’m still seeing double from that eye and can barely see with it, is that, like, temporary?” \n\
  \n\
“my roof got wrecked by something. some kinda charred debris. theres pics in my blog. like if u want me to mess around w/ them!!”\n\
\n\
“You think it’s war? That’s BS. It’s a plan. Look at the timing of the flashes. It doesn’t look like a battle, it looks like signals. Like I said, it’s a secret message from The Third Hundred and the Bilderberg club. They’re still watching”

zorsan_attack_victory.name=A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH
zorsan_attack_victory.desc=A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ASIAN UNION, EUROPEAN ALLIANCE, AND THE AMERICAN ALLIANCE.\n\
Humans. This is a proud name. We have a reason to be proud. The enemy, who everyone thought to be the most advanced and dangerous around, has had its back broken in a senseless invasion. Our adversary was pushed back in the very beginning of the attack, and now he will never see victory.\n\
This is a day of pride. We can be proud of being Human, of fighting back a menace from space, and of staying humane. We can be proud of the fact that no one will ever dare to try to impose their rule or their will on us again.\n\
Of course, we still have not wrestled the piece away from the enemy’s greedy paws. But it will not be long.\n\
And you are the ones who deserve credit for it.


bork_blockade.name=Yet Another Space Launch Failure
bork_blockade.desc=Yet another launch at the Heshsher Space Port was a failure. The reasons are still unknown. As a reminder, this is the eighth failure: the satellites, after having reached a certain altitude, experience a malfunction of certain important flight chains, and return to Earth automatically. Inspections have started at several construction factories after the fact. \n\
Selected comments:\n\
 “If the satellites won’t launch because of a defect, it’s sabotage. So many failures can’t have happened randomly!”\n\
“Have you noticed? The altitude is the same with every launch! What happened to our country?”\n\
“You know why this is? Because there’s no sky and no space, and the scientists are only now beginning to understand it. Come visit my site and get enlightened. PS Turn off your antivirus, it messes with the positive energy.”\n\
“I don’t think it’s so simple… I don’t know if it’s a conspiracy or just incompetence, but if it’s no coincidence, that it’s a conspiracy, right? Or maybe something just won’t let the satellites fly and they won’t tell us what?”

bork_blockade_withdraw.name=Reason For Recent Launch Failures Discovered
bork_blockade_withdraw.desc=After a long investigation, the reason for launch failures at the Heshsher space port was uncovered. The reason was the bad quality of some alloys used for certain parts of the chains. After carefully examining all materials, a ninth trial launch was successfully carried out.

bork_blockade_destroy.name=Flashes in the Sky: Where Are They Coming From?
bork_blockade_destroy.desc=According to the Global Meteorological Organization, the recent flashes in the sky are nothing but a rather rare atmospheric phenomenon that can be explained by heightened moisture and the difference between magnetic potentials. This phenomenon may be observed in the future in the sky above the American Alliance and other international unions. We ask the citizens not to panic.

klisk_trader_drone.name=What Is That Damn Interference?
klisk_trader_drone.desc=Dr Longrock of the Aurora Research Center has agreed to comment on the strange interference that has been a thorn in the side of the planet for several days. According to him, the reason is a serious malfunction of one of the planetary satellites. It is impossible to take it out of commission for now, but there is work being done to repair it already.\n\

An amusing incident happened in a Bulgarian neighborhood in New York. A shootout between two low-level gangsters (their names are not disclosed in the interest of the investigation) went on for three hours, since they would instantly cure their wounds with the new StimBioPack medicine. Later, at the police station, a large amount of bullets was recovered from both bandits (over fifty each). The medical examiner of the police station commented on this: “The important thing is their brains are intact, so they’ll live. Even without the StimBioPack.”

letters.boy.sender=Riku Inoue
letters.boy.name=For the Aurora captain
letters.boy.desc=“Dear Mr Captain of the Aurora 2,\n\
My name is Riku Inoue, I’m from Yamato, I’m seven years old. There was a contest of academic performance at my school, and the best student\
   was allowed to write you a letter. I was the best student, so I’m writing you.\n\
In case you didn’t know, Inoue means “above the well.” And Riku means “Earth.” It isn’t a fitting name, \
  because I’ve always wanted to be an astronaut, like Toyohiro Akiyama. Mom says I have a good name, \
  it’s just that I have too many bad thoughts. She proofread my letter, and I rewrote it.\n\
I really want to be an astronaut. I have lots of photos and books. I like encyclopedias and watching sci-fi. Do you have a blaster like Space Cowboy Yamamoto?\
   You probably do.\n\
Mom says that if I do well in school and do sports, I can get into the same academy you studied at. It’s a very\
   prestigious place. I went there on a tour and there’s a statue of you there.\n\
I will become an astronaut. My friends say that it’s wonderful, but it’s better to be a doctor or a military \
  man, the country needs them more. But I still think being an astronaut is much better than being a \
  doctor or a soldier. Even better than being the Emperor of Japan, even though everyone thinks that being the Emperor of Japan is the best there is.”

letters.boy_2.name=For the Aurora captain
letters.boy_2.desc=Dear Captain of the Aurora 2,\n\
They told me I could write another letter. They said you couldn’t reply because you were constantly in \
  expeditions, but your boss could reply for you. Martan Kilmovee, he said you were old friends, and that\
  he’d kick your butt back in the military academy. I didn’t believe him. If he kicked your butt, he’d be in space, not you.\n\
But he’s still a good man. He said that I really could become an astronaut, and if I couldn’t be a soldier,\
  then there are scientists and even engineers needed in space. To be honest, Mr Captain of the Aurora 2,\
  I was very afraid that I couldn’t become a soldier. I get sick a lot. But I’m very smart. I’m the best student \
  at my school, otherwise they wouldn’t let me write you this letter.\n\
Mr Kilmovee said that if I was serious about my intentions, they would be glad to take me aboard some\
  future Aurora. But I want to serve on yours, because you’re a hero.\n\
I haven’t told you the most important thing: they’re taking me to study at Project Aurora, because I’m so \
  smart! Mom was worried, but Mr Kilmovee calmed her down. He said there was a lot of kids like me \
  there. I wonder if they write you letters too. There must be so many of them.

letters.boy_3.name=For the Aurora captain
letters.boy_3.desc=My mom is very scared. She wanted to take me back to Yamato, but in the end she was brought to \
  Project Aurora instead. She said she doesn’t want me to be here, since the invaders will definitely try to \
  attack the complex. But it’s very well defended, definitely better than our old house.\n\
I have been writing you for years. I grew up writing you letters, Captain. In three years, they were \
  planning to send me to space for the first time. But this is how it turned out. Our planet is attacked. Just like in a sci-fi movie.\n\
\n\
The fear of knowing:\n\
We are not alone in space.\n\
What a bad omen.\n\
\n\
I look around and ask myself: “Riku, are you ready to die fighting for Earth?” I only know that you, the \
  man who has always been my idol, are ready.\n\
And that means that so am I.

letters.scientist.sender=Emiliano Martin
letters.scientist.name=Thank you for your work
letters.scientist.desc=On behalf of all scientists of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, good day!\n\
My name is Emiliano Martin, I am a biology professor. I am very happy to have an opportunity to write you a letter, since it is because of you that I got my Ph.D.! Maybe I did not word it well: I am talking about data and materials given to our university by Project Aurora.\n\
Thanks to you, we have successfully advanced our understanding of many scientific problems! I was told that you would be glad to read about our achievements, and I really do have some things to tell you!\
   For example, you probably know that before, cloning was considered impossible because of limited cellular division capabilities of every given cell. Now, we have managed to clone biomass! Granted, it was the one given to us by Project Aurora, but we did do it! Now imagine what awaits us! Who knows? Maybe it will be because of your mission that we will finally break the barrier of man’s physical imperfection and start developing in a completely new way?\n\
Regards,\n\
Emiliano Martin

letters.scientist_2.name=About progress
letters.scientist_2.desc=Good day!\n\
I brought up an interesting subject in my last letter, don’t you think?  Development in a completely new way. It is exciting just to think about it! As my professor told me, back in my student days: “My mind is a sphere inside endless vacuum. The bigger the sphere, the bigger the\
   surface with which it feels the void around it, the impossibility of ever filling it, its own imperfection.” I only know that I know nothing.\n\
Of course, you and I will not be around to see it, but our descendants will have quite an interesting future left to them. They will face not only what has befallen us – the depletion of their home planet –\
   but also much more dangerous tricks of the Universe! Will they see the Great Attractor up close, heh?\n\
  Will they scatter around Pavo and Indus, Hydra and Centaura, or will they stay to settle the Virgo Cluster? Will they meet creatures even more interesting than the ones you have met?\n\
  I am so excited and happy to be alive now! And I cannot even imagine how you must feel. You are on the razor edge of history, a pioneer! I would even call you superhuman, but that would sound too melodramatic, although that is what you are, in essence!\n\

 It is strange, the way things work out… I have always thought that an intelligent mind is averse to violence. The realization that another sentient creature feels the same things you do, that it, in essence, represents the existing reality as well and considers itself one of its centers, should rid one of any impulse to kill!\n\
 But it turns out that it does not. Space has gifted us with scientific data, it has given us hope. And now it is taking it away. It’s funny: we were afraid of dying on a depleted world, and now a militant civilization is trying to conquer us! Ironic, is it not?\n\
 Many have left my university. Students, employees. The only ones who have stayed are the ones who have nowhere to go and those who are not afraid of the invaders. Am I afraid of them? No, I am old, and I will not be afraid, should anything happen. Besides, there are still those who want to learn here. I teach them.\n\
 Despite all this, I want to look towards the future. I hope that at least our distant descendants will be free of war.\n\
 P.S. And if everything goes badly, there will not be any 'descendants.'\n\
 Regards,\n\

letter.mother.sender=Rosaline Xian
letters.mother.name=HATE YOU
letters.mother.desc=*Notice: Rosaline Xian is mother of corporal Martin Xian KIA in last mission*\n\
They told me I could write you a letter.\n\
I thought about it for a long time. They said they wouldn’t read it, and I wanted to write all I think about you, but then I realized it wasn’t your fault, but…\n\
Tell me, did you know him?! Did you know Martin Xian? He was my boy, my only one, my my my my! Why didn’t you save him?! What kind of captain are you?! Why did my son had to die, why wasn’t it someone else?! I HATE YOU!!! I HATE THE AURORA I HATE ALL OF YOUR SHIPS ALL OF YOUR GODDAMN PROJECTS ALL YOUR SCIENTISTS ALL OF THIS WORLD!!!

letters.mother_2.name=No subject
letters.mother_2.desc=My therapist said that I had to write you and it would help me. So I’m writing you. I’m sorry, but you’ll just have to bear it. My last letter was very bad. The only reason I’m not asking for your forgiveness is because I’m a strong woman. You can’t take back what you said. But do know that I’m sorry.\n\
I still haven’t introduced myself. You probably know my name already, but anyway: Rosaline Xian. You’ve already realized that I’m the mother of Corporal Martin Xian. He died during one of your expeditions. You should know that now, after so much time has passed, I can at least find solace in the fact that you brought back his body. I would have lost my mind if you didn’t. I would have thought he was still alive. I couldn’t think any other way because I’m a mother. You can’t possibly understand.\n\
I don’t think I will ever forgive you. And I won’t forgive Project Aurora either, despite the fact that they’re trying to make my life easier with compensations. Don’t. My son gave his life for you. It was his choice, but I don’t feel any better about it.

letters.mother_3.name=No subject
letters.mother_3.desc=I have to say this. Happy about going to space now, idiots? You should have let sleeping dogs lie, but you had to wake them up.\n\
Although, to be honest, I don’t want any of this. I don’t want to think that this was all for nothing, because that would mean that my Martin died in vain. My words were hurtful, and I’m sorry because there will be more death and more suffering. You will probably get even more letters from old hags like me who lost their sons.\n\
A long time ago, my neighbors would visit me. They felt sorry for me because of Martin’s death.\n\
Then, their children started visiting. They would ask me about him, they thought he was a hero. I never told them about my son.\n\
But two days ago, I did. He really was a hero. And his death saved them from something, gave them something. Those children asked me: will we get conquered? They think I know because people from Aurora come to me so often. I told them we wouldn’t. We have people like my Martin with us. And people like you.\n\
Do I hate you? Some time ago, I would say yes. A little later, I’d say I didn’t know. And now, probably not. Definitely not. Maybe I’m just getting old, weak and sentimental, but I don’t want to hate you anymore.\n\
And I wish you luck. I honestly do.
