icarus_0.name=Breakthrough in Solar Power Use?
icarus_0.desc=According to the data from the official Project Aurora news, one of its ships has brought highly valuable data concerning the use of solar energy from its expedition. \n\
Data and technology acquired from an alien beacon-like structure can lead to a creation of much more effective ways of collecting and transferring solar power, which could give humanity the ‘free energy’ it has coveted for so long. Scientists at Earth laboratories are now carefully studying retrieved material and are preparing an official statement

icarus_1.name=Good Work
icarus_1.desc=Greetings.\n\
Perhaps you have already heard about Project Icarus? A few more years and the Earth energy crisis will be over once and for all. And this is done thanks to your effort. Good job, captain!\n\
A. V. Buren, Aurora CEO

icarus_2.name=Free Energy Tomorrow?
icarus_2.desc=The world’s scientific society is shocked by the discoveries made by analyzing materials retrieved from an alien beacon by a Project Aurora ship, as they disprove all that we knew about using solar energy. New discoveries have lead to the creation of new cheap ways of extracting power from the Sun. \n\
As Earth energy reserves are nearly depleted, scientists use this new knowledge to present a solution: Project Icarus, a series of energy consuming space stations surrounding the Sun.\n\
The construction of the first station has already started.

icarus_3.name=First Icarus Station Launched
icarus_3.desc=The world is holding its breath while watching how the first gigawatt of energy is transferred from the Icarus 1 station to Earth. Though the launch of the station was delayed several times, it has finally been launched, and is producing power for the needs of Earth. \n\
Experts predict energy prices dropping by 15% by the end of the year, and the special power regulation laws in some of the most populated Earth regions being cancelled.

icarus_4.name==Energy Crisis Over, Labor Crisis Incoming?
icarus_4.desc=For the last few months after the Icarus power station has reached its full productivity, troubling news have been coming from UN power plants and factories. Cheap solar energy has rendered these structures obsolete. While the ecologists and the general population praise Project Icarus, power tycoons and workers hate it and are trying to sabotage the construction of new stations. \n\
Many workers in the energy production sector have lost their jobs. Strikes and uprisings took place in Russia, Egypt and European countries, which makes future of Icarus project unclear.

Read more in the next issue of 'Galaxy News'.

evac_start.name=Colonization Begins!
evac_start.desc=UN government together with Project Aurora officials has made a long-expected announcement. Finally humanity begins interstellar colonization! \n\
Currently, everyone can make a request to enter the colonization program. Of course, preference is given to those who have good health and expertise, suitable for the needs of the new colony. \n\
A colonization plan has been drafted for the next 10 years, and new interstellar ships are being constructed entirely for its purposes. The first colony ship is to take off shortly.

evac_start_2.name=Form #312-b [TOP SECRET]
evac_start_2.desc=As a high-ranking Project Aurora officer, you are permitted to select 2 people that will be taken to a new colony. They are guaranteed a place on the evacuation ship. \n\
They must be no older than 45 years, be your first-order relatives (including wife and children), and pass a medical test. Please, fill out the attached form and submit it to the Aurora Special Operations Desk. \n\
Remember, the number of people we can save is heavily limited, so choose wisely. If you do not have any relatives you personally want to save, report this as soon as possible.

press_conference_1.name=Project Aurora News
press_conference_1.desc=The most significant news of the last few days is the return of the Aurora 2, the second ship created by Project Aurora. As you may remember, the first one disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and there are no updates about it at the moment.\n\
Right after returning to Earth, the captain of the Aurora 2 attended a press conference where he answered some of the hottest-burning questions. The captain made it clear that he was not of the meek sort, and that space that had welcomed him with vast new territories was not going to stay unexplored for long. Not even meeting other intelligent species is going to get in the way of that: despite the fact that the mission of the Aurora 2 is a peaceful one, its crew is ready to use force without hesitation should the need arise. But that does not mean that there will be no cooperation with the aliens: in fact, the opposite is true, even though they are foreign. And what about their mission objective? The captain said with certainty that we are very close to having a normal life again.\n\
In the end, when answering the question concerning the search for the missing Aurora 1, the captain noted that there are more pressing matters, mentioning “saving the planet.” Does it sound histrionic? Yes. But we can understand where he is coming from.

Right after returning to Earth, the captain of the Aurora 2 attended a press conference where he answered some of the hottest-burning questions. The captain made it clear that, despite the gravity of the mission, he is very professional in what he does. He reacted in the same vein to a certain immodest female reporter, which reveals him as a cold professional. When talking about interplanetary cooperation, he stated that such diplomatic connections will be established shortly, and they may turn out to be long-term. The captain did not go into specifics when talking about his mission objective, confining himself to vague hints at possible success of the voyage.\n\
When answering a question about looking for the Aurora 1, the captain stated that the search is underway, but its priority was not as high on the list as the main objective of the Aurora 2.

Right after returning to Earth, the captain of the Aurora 2 attended a press conference where he answered some of the hottest-burning questions. It became clear that for the captain of the Aurora 2, space is something beautiful and novel, with a hint of romance, which reveals him as someone who is truly in love with his job. He is just as excited about interplanetary contact, which is a good thing for a modern pioneer of deep space. He also remarked that such contact (in any shape or form) is very important for humanity, and work is already being done about it having a favorable image. What does raise concern is the crisis question: the captain not only declined to give a clear answer, but it could also be seen from the way he looked that the Aurora 2 was not doing great.\n\
Concluding the press conference with some information about the search for the Aurora 1, the captain assured us that its trail had already been found and the search was bound to be a success, thus giving hope to the families left behind by the ship’s numerous crew members.

zorsan_attack_1.name=A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH
zorsan_attack_1.desc=A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ASIAN UNION, EUROPEAN ALLIANCE, AND THE AMERICAN ALLIANCE.\n\
 Humans. Yes, humans, because we grew out of internal intrigue and conflict a long time ago. We are now in the Space Age, the Age of New Discoveries. The Age of Unity.\n\
Unfortunately, it just so happened that as soon as we went to space, we gained a new enemy. An enemy who is dangerous, strong, and who has already declared war on us. The kind of war we are not acquainted with: war in space.\n\
Our enemy was drawn in by our inexperience and apparent defenselessness. But when they come here, they will know what humans are really like. The enemy will be crushed. Victory will be ours. We will have peace once again.\n\
Because of all this, from now on temporary martial law is declared across all of Earth.\n\
New rules and regulations will be transmitted daily using local television channels, newspapers, and flyers. Follow them and pay attention to the announcements of local civil protection and defense forces.\n\
\n\
AN ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH FROM POPE GREGORY XVII\n\
Pope Gregory XVII, in his address to the people of Earth, called for avoidance of malice and showing the enemy more mercy. “Be humane,” said the Pope, “because even though we are enemies, that much is temporary, but peace is forever.”\n\
The Pope’s message was approved by the Patriarch of Moscow and All Rus Adrian and Khalif Ibrahim Abd Abu al-Hair. Dalai Lama Gyaltsen refused to comment, citing the need for neutrality in such questions.

zorsan_attack_2.desc=”Guys, I have a question. So I was looking at the night sky through a telescope. It’s been shining weirdly lately, you know? Kind of interesting. So I was looking at it, right, and BAM! A flash! And I got blinded. First question: where do I get shaded lenses? Second question: I’m still seeing double from that eye and can barely see with it, is that, like, temporary?” \n\
  \n\
“my roof got wrecked by something. some kinda charred debris. theres pics in my blog. like if u want me to mess around w/ them!!”\n\
\n\
“You think it’s war? That’s BS. It’s a plan. Look at the timing of the flashes. It doesn’t look like a battle, it looks like signals. Like I said, it’s a secret message from The Third Hundred and the Bilderberg club. They’re still watching”

zorsan_attack_victory.desc=A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ASIAN UNION, EUROPEAN ALLIANCE, AND THE AMERICAN ALLIANCE.\n\
Humans. This is a proud name. We have a reason to be proud. The enemy, who everyone thought to be the most advanced and dangerous around, has had its back broken in a senseless invasion. Our adversary was pushed back in the very beginning of the attack, and now he will never see victory.\n\   
This is a day of pride. We can be proud of being Human, of fighting back a menace from space, and of staying humane. We can be proud of the fact that no one will ever dare to try to impose their rule or their will on us again.\n\
Of course, we still have not wrestled the piece away from the enemy’s greedy paws. But it will not be long.\n\
And you are the ones who deserve credit for it.


bork_blockade.name=Yet Another Space Launch Failure
bork_blockade.desc=Yet another launch at the Heshsher Space Port was a failure. The reasons are still unknown. As a reminder, this is the eighth failure: the satellites, after having reached a certain altitude, experience a malfunction of certain important flight chains, and return to Earth automatically. Inspections have started at several construction factories after the fact. \n\
Selected comments:\n\
 “If the satellites won’t launch because of a defect, it’s sabotage. So many failures can’t have happened randomly!”\n\
“Have you noticed? The altitude is the same with every launch! What happened to our country?”\n\
“You know why this is? Because there’s no sky and no space, and the scientists are only now beginning to understand it. Come visit my site and get enlightened. PS Turn off your antivirus, it messes with the positive energy.”\n\
“I don’t think it’s so simple… I don’t know if it’s a conspiracy or just incompetence, but if it’s no coincidence, that it’s a conspiracy, right? Or maybe something just won’t let the satellites fly and they won’t tell us what?”

bork_blockade_withdraw.name=Reason For Recent Launch Failures Discovered
bork_blockade_withdraw.desc=After a long investigation, the reason for launch failures at the Heshsher space port was uncovered. The reason was the bad quality of some alloys used for certain parts of the chains. After carefully examining all materials, a ninth trial launch was successfully carried out.

bork_blockade_destroy.name=Flashes in the Sky: Where Are They Coming From?
bork_blockade_destroy.desc=According to the Global Meteorological Organization, the recent flashes in the sky are nothing but a rather rare atmospheric phenomenon that can be explained by heightened moisture and the difference between magnetic potentials. This phenomenon may be observed in the future in the sky above the American Alliance and other international unions. We ask the citizens not to panic.

inside.name=New Medicine!
inside.desc=The bleeding edge of medicine: a packet dubbed the StimBioPack miraculously cures even serious wounds instantly!\n\
Why is it so effective? We do not know, but according to our source, it has to do with the mission of the Aurora 2 space ship…\n\
\n\
An amusing incident happened in a Bulgarian neighborhood in New York. A shootout between two low-level gangsters (their names are not disclosed in the interest of the investigation) went on for three hours, since they would instantly cure their wounds with the new StimBioPack medicine. Later, at the police station, a large amount of bullets was recovered from both bandits (over fifty each). The medical examiner of the police station commented on this: “The important thing is their brains are intact, so they’ll live. Even without the StimBioPack.”
