sarah_about_aliens.3=Ewww!
sarah_about_aliens.2=*Sarah shrugs and makes a face.* Ew! Cap, ew! Why did you put that image in my head?!
sarah_about_aliens.2.0=Heh heh.
sarah_about_aliens.1=Yep. Like the ones in those Captain Shepherd movies. In every movie he has a hot new alien girlfriend. And these are all... ew... especially the Klisks! Cap, I'm not racist, but... they're slugs!
sarah_about_aliens.0=Yeah, it's much more fun here than it seemed before. It's not like in the movies. *Sarah snorts.* I thought it'd all be more beautiful.
sarah_about_aliens.1.0=Ahem. Seems like that Captain Shepherd sure gets around. Too bad I haven't seen those movies. So, what do you think, could he have... well... you know, with a Klisk?
sarah_about_aliens.3.0=I see you have something to think about. I won't get in the way, Frontz. Over and out.
