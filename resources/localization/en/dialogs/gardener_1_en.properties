gardener_1.4=*his speech sounds really weird even despite the fact that his grammar and stresses are alright* I knew you would ask. But I can not tell you.
gardener_1.3=Yes, the Aurora it was called. It is a beautiful name. The Aurora. It is really enjoyable to pronounce it.
gardener_1.2=*It harrumphs and interrupts you.* You're not the first. Three hundred seventy four earth days ago we met another spaceship that was similar to yours.
gardener_1.13.1=The way? Do you mean the future?
gardener_1.1=*Its answers are brief and its voice sounds really unusual to a human ear.* Yes.
gardener_1.13.0=Who are you?
gardener_1.0=*You see a creature on a display. It matches the description in the report of the Aurora-1 commander. Indeed, the creature looks way too... human-like. The hat covers its sparkling eyes, whilst its cloak covers the rest of the body. It's easy to mistake it for a human. It waits for you to speak.*
gardener_1.5.0=Please, tell me the location of the Aurora. Where is it? Our entire planet depends on the Aurora.
gardener_1.12.1=You see what happens\u2026 Do you see the future?
gardener_1.12.0=Its hard to understand you. Just tell me what should I do to find Aurora
gardener_1.4.0=But why?
gardener_1.99=Captain\u2026 *she is confused* There.. There is some kind of malfunction here. All defences went down for a couple of seconds! Now everything is working again. I will try to find the cause.
gardener_1.98=Captain. The weapon systems are offline. We are rebooting and reloading now but it will take some time.
gardener_1.3.0=Where is it? Where is the Aurora now? Do you know? Do you know the answer to this question?
gardener_1.97=Henry nods and disconnects. You switch back to the alien.
gardener_1.19.0=I do not understand. What \"begins\"?
gardener_1.2.0=What? The Aurora? Did you see the Aurora?
gardener_1.18.0=What?
gardener_1.1.0=Then on behalf of Earth and the entire humankind, the first human spaceship greets...
gardener_1.9.0=Can you help us with that?
gardener_1.99.0=I see *Henry is also calling*
gardener_1.0.0=Do... do you understand me?
gardener_1.21=*Link terminated*
gardener_1.21.0=Damn it was strange. But what else should you expect from an alien?
gardener_1.20=There and back again in circles. You will understand. Farewell, human captain. We will meet again.
gardener_1.8.1=I do not understand. What do you mean? How can I find Aurora?
gardener_1.8.0=Who are you?
gardener_1.98.0=I see. Go on. Report immediately if it happens again.
gardener_1.20.0=Wait!
gardener_1.7.0=Sarah?
gardener_1.97.0=\u2026
gardener_1.14.2=I do not understand. What do you mean? How can I find Aurora?
gardener_1.19=The Klisk. Their station is located in this system. Check it. Everything begins here.
gardener_1.14.1=Who are you?
gardener_1.14.0=So you want us to follow our own path but you will not show it to us. Right?
gardener_1.18=Resources? *he laughs* Look around\u2026 and take whatever you want. This garden is endless. You do not need the help, but you may need the Klisk.
gardener_1.6.2=Ok. Anyway I do not have time for this. Do you know why did we have to send these deep space research ships?
gardener_1.9=You live on a dying planet. You need a contact. Help. Resources.
gardener_1.6.1=Okay, my path. If you use this phrase, apparently, it means something. What does it mean?
gardener_1.8=Paths. There are plenty of them. And we all get changed by the ones we choose. You do not want to change by stepping on a wrong road, don't you?
gardener_1.6.0=Hell no! I don't know, what you mean, but I swear I'll shred you into small pieces, if you don't give me the information.
gardener_1.7=*the creature shows no aggression* Humans\u2026 You must all be the same. *The gardeners eyes flash. Suddenly the alarm sounds and the computer voice informs about all weapon system critical malfunction. You receive an incoming call from Sarah*
gardener_1.14=There is no future. Everything moves in circles. You will understand it but not right now. But you will.
gardener_1.6=We can't tell you. If you follow your path, you might meet the Aurora.
gardener_1.13=The smart can find the way, the strong can make its own.
gardener_1.5=Because the Aurora has its own path and you have your own path.
gardener_1.12=*Short laughter*I have already told you\u2026 We are the Gardeners. Look around, isn't it beautiful here? This is the garden. It does not belong to us. It... *he suddenly stumples* we just look after it. And we see what will happen with the plants.
