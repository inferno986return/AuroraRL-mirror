gardener_1.4=I knew you would ask that. No. That is not in my power.
gardener_1.3=It is so. Aurora\u2026 Aurora. Aurora. *laughter* I like saying this word. Aurora. Au-rora. Au. Ro. Ra.
gardener_1.2=*Something that sounds like mocking.* I know who you are. A long time ago... one year ago. More. We saw a ship like yours. The Aurora 1. We gave them the ability to talk to everyone, and it was not in vain. You talk to me, and we understand each other.
gardener_1.13.1=Path? Is it me or do you mean\u2026 the future?
gardener_1.1=It is so. *The creature's voice is unusual, you can hear wooden sounds in it, strange rattling, clangs.* I\u2026 We\u2026 Gardener. Gardeners. Call us that.
gardener_1.13.0=Who are you?
gardener_1.0=*Before you is a creature. It looks surprisingly human-like, and reminds you more of a fairy tale character than an alien. You can see it yourself, can't you? A pair of eyes glows in the darkness under its hat. Human eyes don't glow like that. It's time to turn on the device from the Aurora 1 and start talking.*
gardener_1.5.0=I repeat, it is very important for all of my people.
gardener_1.12.1=You can see what will happen to them? Are you trying to say that you can see the future?
gardener_1.12.0=Hard to understand. Just tell me what to do to find the Aurora 1.
gardener_1.4.0=Why not?
gardener_1.99=Captain\u2026 *She's embarrassed.* Some\u2026 Some kind of bug in the system! All the shields went down in a second! Even radar defense! It's back up, but... I'll sort it out, Cap. I'll find out what caused it.
gardener_1.98=Captain. *His voice is dry, but you can see that Henry is nervous.* Weapon systems are down. It's like the energy just disappeared. We're feeding them again, but it's not going very fast.
gardener_1.3.0=In that case, I'll ask you a question. A very important one. Can you tell me where the Aurora 1 is right now?
gardener_1.97=*Henry nods and disappears from the screen. You go back to the Gardener.*
gardener_1.19.0=I don't understand. What will it start?
gardener_1.2.0=Aurora 1? You came in contact with the Aurora 1?
gardener_1.18.0=Who?
gardener_1.1.0=We greet you. On behalf of Earth and all of humanity. We are humans. Our ship is the Aurora 2.
gardener_1.9.0=Can you help us with that?
gardener_1.99.0=Of course. *Henry is trying to contact you.*
gardener_1.0.0=Can you understand me?
gardener_1.21=*It's no use. He disconnected.*
gardener_1.21.0=Damn. That was\u2026 weird. First contact is first contact.
gardener_1.20=*The Gardener's eyes flash.* Back and forth, and then in circles\u2026 You will understand. Until next time, human captain. It will not be soon.
gardener_1.8.1=I don't understand. What do you want to tell me? What do I do to find the Aurora?!
gardener_1.8.0=Who are you?
gardener_1.98.0=I see. Go on. Report if this happens again..
gardener_1.20.0=Wait!
gardener_1.7.0=Sarah?
gardener_1.97.0=\u2026
gardener_1.14.2=I don't understand. What do you want to tell me? What do I do to find the Aurora?!
gardener_1.19=Klisks. Their station is here. Look for it. That will be what starts it all.
gardener_1.14.1=Who are you?
gardener_1.14.0=Okay. Right. You want us to follow our own path. But you can't point us to it.
gardener_1.18=Resources? *laughs* Look around\u2026 and take them from wherever you want. This Garden is endless, and it is getting bigger every second. You do not need our help. You need the Klisks.
gardener_1.6.2=Okay. I don't have time for this, anyway. If you contacted the Aurora 1, you probably know why humans have gone out to outer space.
gardener_1.9=Yes. You are the people of a dying planet. You need contact. You need help. You need resources.
gardener_1.6.1=Paths. Why are you talking about roads? What do you mean?
gardener_1.8=Paths. Lots of them. We are all changed by the paths we choose... You don't want to accidentally change after setting out down someone else's road, do you? It is what makes us different. We are perfectly aware of the borders between our paths and the others'.
gardener_1.6.0=I am asking politely, but I could use force.
gardener_1.7=Oh. Humans. Maybe you are all like that. *The Gardener's eyes flash, but it doesn't stop there. Suddenly, the ship's alarm goes off. Synthesized voice informs you that external defense systems have been deactivated.* See? *After that the alarm quiets down. Sarah instantly hails you on the second line.*
gardener_1.14=There is no future. Everything moves back and forth, in circles. You will understand this, but not now. But you will.
gardener_1.6=We cannot. Different ships have different paths. But you can trust me... *The creature's eyes flash. No, it really does, it looks as if two flashlights got turned on in the dark gap below the hat.* You will definitely meet.
gardener_1.13=He who is strong and intelligent will find the path. Or he will lay it.
gardener_1.5=The Aurora 1 has its own path, and you have yours.
gardener_1.12=*laughter* I told you\u2026 We are Gardeners. Look around. Is it not beautiful? It is the Garden. It is not ours. Nor is it yours. It... *He stutters. It looks weird.* We just tend to it. And we can see what will happen to the plants.
