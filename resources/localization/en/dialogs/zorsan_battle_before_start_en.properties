zorsan_battle_before_start.0.0=You're not okay.
zorsan_battle_before_start.16.2=Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?
zorsan_battle_before_start.21.0=That's pretty vague.
zorsan_battle_before_start.16.1=I can see you haven't exactly taken care of yourself.
zorsan_battle_before_start.16.0=Are you afraid?
zorsan_battle_before_start.8.0=You're a bit unhinged, Martan, that's all. Calm down.
zorsan_battle_before_start.20.2=Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?
zorsan_battle_before_start.20.1=Was there that much work?
zorsan_battle_before_start.15.2=Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?
zorsan_battle_before_start.20.0=Are you afraid?
zorsan_battle_before_start.15.1=I can see you haven't exactly taken care of yourself.
zorsan_battle_before_start.15.0=Are you afraid?
zorsan_battle_before_start.7.0=It'll all be over soon.
zorsan_battle_before_start.14.1=Is it bad?
zorsan_battle_before_start.14.0=So it's not that bad, is it?
zorsan_battle_before_start.6.0=There. Now you look more like yourself to me.
zorsan_battle_before_start.23=No one is. I doubt that trying to fight a war in space by Earth rules will lead to anything good.
zorsan_battle_before_start.22=I can't give you any other instructions now. You'll get them as they come.
zorsan_battle_before_start.5.2=Calm down. I understand you. I'm very scared, too.
zorsan_battle_before_start.21=The main thing is, don't leave the system. We have no idea what to expect. So you just have to stay on your guard and be alert.
zorsan_battle_before_start.5.1=You said it yourself, it all depends on you. You need to stay focused.
zorsan_battle_before_start.20=Damn right.
zorsan_battle_before_start.13.0=So, what do we have?
zorsan_battle_before_start.5.0=Martan Kilmovee has gone soft. Well, I think I'll go grab a skird and ballet shoes. You want them pink?
zorsan_battle_before_start.4.3=Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?
zorsan_battle_before_start.4.2=I can see you haven't exactly taken care of yourself.
zorsan_battle_before_start.4.1=Was there that much work?
zorsan_battle_before_start.12.0=So, what do we have?
zorsan_battle_before_start.4.0=We've known each other for years. Tell me.
zorsan_battle_before_start.19=*Martan looks at you with a truly unique expression.* I have no time for that.
zorsan_battle_before_start.11.0=So, what do we have?
zorsan_battle_before_start.3.0=What are you afraid of?
zorsan_battle_before_start.18=I sent her and our son to a guarded complex. It's safer there.
zorsan_battle_before_start.17=What can I do? *He shrugs.* All of the responsibility is mine. There's a lot of work. I sleep right here. On the sofa in the break room.
zorsan_battle_before_start.16=No. But you can't say our situation is great, either. *Martan grabs his head and looks a bit like a sleep-walker again.*
zorsan_battle_before_start.15=That's right. *Martan grabs his head and looks a bit like a sleep-walker again.*
zorsan_battle_before_start.9=Yeah\u2026 Yeah\u2026 I need to calm down.
zorsan_battle_before_start.14=We have your Aurora 2. Not the worst ship, but it's a research vessel, not a combat one. We have Flagship Voyager, you know it. ICS-34... honestly, it's more like our last line of defense, along with the AA guns. And there are short-flight space ships, they aren't a great help, but it's better than nothing.
zorsan_battle_before_start.8=Will you look at that. He's scared. Don't lie. You've always been strange. I can't see any emotion at all in your face. It's like you're not you, like you're someone's doll, a puppet. What the hell do you even know?! *He punches the wall and moans in pain.* Right... Right, sorry. I just flew off the handle. But yeah, thanks. I feel better now.
zorsan_battle_before_start.13=You didn't manage to get the aliens to help us, and that's bad. But the Voyager is the apex of our technological genius. I think it'll contribute to the fight greatly.
zorsan_battle_before_start.7=Need. Everyone needs me to do something. My bosses need something. My employees need something. You need something. My wife needs something. My son needs something. Everyone needs something from me. And it's all on me... aaaah! *He hits the table with his fist and screams.* Yeah... in any case, thanks. I feel better now.
zorsan_battle_before_start.19.0=I don't get it\u2026 But that's expected. I'm not a family man.
zorsan_battle_before_start.12=The Voyager is our best weapon. Too bad that not all aliens have helped us. But even so, the Voyager turned out\u2026 impressive.
zorsan_battle_before_start.6=*Still completely calm, Martan picks up something fragile from the desk (looks like a voice recorder) and throws it at the wall. The thing breaks. Next time, he'll throw it at you. He exhales.* Yeah... you know... I feel a bit better now.
zorsan_battle_before_start.11=What about it? It's great. With our latest tech and what the aliens have provided... It's a scary weapon. You just have to remember that we only have one.
zorsan_battle_before_start.10.3=By the way, what's up with that Voyager?
zorsan_battle_before_start.5=*He still has the expression of an incredibly tired man.* I have a wife and child. We're getting attacked. I'm afraid. *He stops again. But then he starts talking. His cheek twitches.* It all depends on me. And I'm tired. And I don't know if you'll win.
zorsan_battle_before_start.2.3=Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?
zorsan_battle_before_start.10=*Martan's face becomes a bit brighter. He looks a bit more sane now.* We armed everything we could. We had old ship projects that never went beyond one or two prototypes... Well, that'll be the support for you and the Voyager.
zorsan_battle_before_start.10.2=By the way, what's up with that Voyager?
zorsan_battle_before_start.4=*His expression doesn't change.* Can't be assed to explain. I don't want to explain.
zorsan_battle_before_start.2.2=I can see you haven't exactly taken care of yourself.
zorsan_battle_before_start.10.1=By the way, what's up with that Voyager?
zorsan_battle_before_start.3=I'm afraid.
zorsan_battle_before_start.2.1=Was there that much work?
zorsan_battle_before_start.10.0=By the way, what's up with that Voyager?
zorsan_battle_before_start.2=I haven't slept for five days. Six. Yeah, six. I haven't slept. We're running out of time. They're coming soon\u2026
zorsan_battle_before_start.2.0=Are you afraid?
zorsan_battle_before_start.1=I'm not okay. *He stops to wait for your reaction.*
zorsan_battle_before_start.0=*Martan is looking at you. His face is glistening and his hair is greasy. There's a spot of some sauce on his collar. In general, his expression is a bit crazy.*
zorsan_battle_before_start.23.0=In that case, I'll be off.
zorsan_battle_before_start.18.0=Right, but do you call them, talk to them?
zorsan_battle_before_start.1.0=What happened?
zorsan_battle_before_start.22.1=In that case, I'll be off.
zorsan_battle_before_start.9.2=Which is exactly why I'm here. Let's not waste any time. What do I have to do?
zorsan_battle_before_start.22.0=What about the Voyager? Which one of us is the boss?
zorsan_battle_before_start.9.1=I can see you haven't exactly taken care of yourself.
zorsan_battle_before_start.17.0=Oh\u2026 And what does Ntanda think about that?
zorsan_battle_before_start.9.0=Was there that much work?
