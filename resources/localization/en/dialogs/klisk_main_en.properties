klisk_main.111=I don't think so. *you hear his sympathizing cracking*
klisk_main.13=They don't have any diplomatic relationships with the other races, so there is almost no information about them. You have to choose something else.
klisk_main.15.0=Why not? What services does your station provide?
klisk_main.110=Well, you can do it only by throwing out the device itself with the sphere from your spaceship?
klisk_main.12=Have you got anything else or should I ask to open an airlock?
klisk_main.11=Yes. Our bank is really reliable. We use the Trading Codex to close any deal.
klisk_main.10=It's one strange decision, but who am I to judge? During the first trade you can use the cash money, but I highly recommend you to open an account in our bank.
klisk_main.14.1=Give me one more information package.
klisk_main.14.0=Cash it out.
klisk_main.13.0=What a shame. I was really looking forward to receiving that information. But that's okay. Could you please repeat the whole list?
klisk_main.12.1=No, I'd rather fly away. Thank you. It was a decent trade.
klisk_main.12.0=Yes, I have a few questions.
klisk_main.109=The sphere doesn't communicate with any form of organic life. It doesn't even notice you. As for the spaceship\u00C9 *the klisk thinks about something* I think he might.
klisk_main.108=Such spheres, as you have already understood, is a battery of some sort. If they want to stay alive, they need to find some kind of mechanism or electronic device, which they can charge.
klisk_main.11.0=I'll think about it tomorrow.
klisk_main.107=Its thoughts are really different from ours, commander. It doesn't think that it is worth communicating with the organic forms of life, because you\u00D5re like stars or meteorites for its perception. Do you try to communicate with meteorites, commander? I don\u00D5t think so.
klisk_main.106=The blue sphere is the blue sphere. It's alive. It\u00D5s a sphere of energy that has its own mind. There are lot of such spheres in the Universe.
klisk_main.105=Well, we can do that\u00C9 *the klisk laughs* It all depends on what intentions and plans you have. I can explain what it is even for free, but you'll have to pay me, if you want to get any other kind of help.
klisk_main.10.0=The klisk bank?
klisk_main.9.0=\u00C9
klisk_main.8.0=Well, I guess I have no other choice, but to choose something else.
klisk_main.7.1=No, it's time for me to go. It was a good trade.
klisk_main.7.0=Yes, I'd like to use the services of your station.
klisk_main.6.5=Nothing. I'd prefer to get the money.
klisk_main.6.4=What's up with the gardeners?
klisk_main.6.3=Tell me more about the zorsans.
klisk_main.6.2=I'd go with the rogues.
klisk_main.6.1=Let's talk about the klisks.
klisk_main.6.0=The borks.
klisk_main.5.5=Can you say anything about the gardeners?
klisk_main.5.4=Neither. I'd like to get credits.
klisk_main.5.3=Tell me about the zorsans. It's an empire! Sounds interesting.
klisk_main.5.2=What can you say about the rogues?
klisk_main.5.1=I'd like to know more about your people.
klisk_main.5.0=I want to know more about the borks.
klisk_main.4.1=Unfortunately, I have no time. Thank you and good luck. Open the airlock door!
klisk_main.4.0=Thank you. Yes, I need one more thing.
klisk_main.3.1=No-no, nothing. I was mistaken. Let's talk about something else.
klisk_main.3.0=I found a strange blue sphere on the spaceship. Apparently, it is alive , but we don't know how to communicate with it. Can you help us out?
klisk_main.2.2=Sure. You\u00D5ll find all the information you need in this folder.
klisk_main.2.1=Well, I guess so. But I can give you only superficial information.
klisk_main.2.0=No, I'd rather talk about it later. I'm sorry.
klisk_main.0.6=Nothing special. My crew needs some rest, so I decided to dock to the safe and quiet space station.
klisk_main.0.5=I want to talk about\u00C9
klisk_main.0.4=I'm interested in getting the coordinates of the capitals of the other races.
klisk_main.0.3=You've mentioned planets, which we can colonize.
klisk_main.0.2=I want to sell you some information.
klisk_main.0.1=I want to trade with you. By the way, I have a 10 percent discount and I want to use it right now.
klisk_main.0.0=I want to trade with you.
klisk_main.109.5=I don't think that I need anything right now. See you later. Over.

klisk_main.114.0=And, once again, what did you say about free help?
klisk_main.113.1=Okay, let's forget about it. But what else can I do?
klisk_main.113.0=Just take my money and do it!
klisk_main.9=The codex tells us that the good trade makes us better, whilst the bad one brings harm to both of us. Good luck, the human commander. I'll order to open the airlock doors for you.
klisk_main.8=*refusing cracking* Unfortunately, I can\u00D5t do that. The first reason is that we know nothing about the gardeners. The second reason is that they don\u00D5t have any diplomatic relationships with the other races. You\u00D5ll have to choose something else.
klisk_main.7=It's a good decision. The information is sent to your computer. Do you need something else?
klisk_main.6=What information package do you want to receive for this?
klisk_main.5=What type of information are you interested in?
klisk_main.112.1=Okay. Here's your money.
klisk_main.4=What a shame. But it\u00D5s all up to you, the human commander. The Trading Codex gives the right to do what you think is necessary. Do you need something else on our space station?
klisk_main.112.0=Can you do it for free?
klisk_main.111.6=I don't think that I need anything right now. See you later. Over.

klisk_main.111.4=I need it to leave my spaceship.
klisk_main.18.1=Unfortunately, no. The government insists on the fast and effective actions. And the \u00D4fast\u00D5 is the key word in this context. Over.
klisk_main.111.3=Can the sphere harm my spaceship or my crew?
klisk_main.18.0=Sure. What services do you provide?
klisk_main.0=Greetings, the human commander. I'm glad to see you on our space station. What do you want?
klisk_main.111.2=Why did it stick to our research console?
klisk_main.111.1=Why doesn't it communicate with us?
klisk_main.111.0=Okay. What is it?
klisk_main.17.0=\u00C9
klisk_main.110.0=Are you serious? Is there any other way?
klisk_main.16.0=My race is used to wars.
klisk_main.116=Ask your questions, the human commander.
klisk_main.18=Is it good or bad? There is no right answer. But it's irrelevant. Does our station have something else you're interested in?
klisk_main.115=Okay. Open the airlock, I'm going to you.
klisk_main.17=I'm happy that you think so. Good luck, the human commander.
klisk_main.114=Well, you have two options, the human commander. You can either put up with stowaway on your spaceship or\u00C9 And, come again, to what thing did it stick to? To your research console, eh? I suppose losing this console will be a tragedy to you.
klisk_main.16=Yes. I'm sending the information. Done. Keep in mind that the creatures of this planet are not the best neighbours in the galaxy. But it's well worth it.
klisk_main.113=Commander, I do warn you! *you hear the loud and monotonous cracking* The chances of success are really low! I don't think that the sphere will leave your spaceship, you're wasting your money!
klisk_main.15=As you say, commander. Do you want to look on what you can spend your money on?
klisk_main.112=Well, I can communicate with the sphere. It is really hard and expensive. It'll cost you 6 credits.
klisk_main.14=That's a good decision. I'll send the information on your computer. What should we do with your bonus?
klisk_main.15.1=You know, I'm not that interested in it. Unfortunately, I have to go. But it was a good trade!
