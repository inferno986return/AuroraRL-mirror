unity_station_embassy_rogues.19.0=Well, then?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.29.1=Go on?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.29.0=I don't quite understand. How could you consider the Mothership the only place with life if you reached it with spaceships?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.18.0=Well, then?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.39.0=I hope we both remember that. Goodbye, Ambassador.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.28.1=Go on?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.17.2=I think you're having a laugh at us.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.28.0=Wait a minute. You believed in the Devourer before you knew it existed?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.17.1=Surely we can do it.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.17.0=I suppose we have.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.27.2=Go on?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.38.0=I see. Okay, transfer your coordinates.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.27.1=Wait a minute. You believed in the Devourer before you knew it existed?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.27.0=I don't quite understand. How could you consider the Mothership the only place with life if you reached it with spaceships?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.16.0=We're trying to do something.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.15.4=You wanted to see me.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.15.3=What's with those Rogues? Why are they all chained to the wall by those cables?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.37.0=What if I don't?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.15.2=It's very unusual here. Not in a good way, excuse me for being so direct.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.26.0=Hm. That actually reminds me of something\u2026 anyway. What about the Rogues?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.15.1=Where are you?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.15.0=I thought the rogue Ambassador was Mr Firshe, the one I met at the session.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.36.3=Let's not focus on the details. Where exactly do I start?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.36.2=Ruins?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.36.1=Artifacts?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.36.0=The Builders? I think I've heard of them.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.25.0=I suppose you're going to talk about the Zorsan.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.14.0=Are you hinting that our system is doomed?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.35.2=Let's not focus on the details. Where exactly do I start?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.35.1=Ruins?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.13.3=You wanted to see me.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.35.0=The Builders? I think I've heard of them.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.13.2=It's very unusual here. Not in a good way, excuse me for being so direct.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.24.0=*continue listening*

unity_station_embassy_rogues.13.0=I thought the rogue Ambassador was Mr Firshe, the one I met at the session.

unity_station_embassy_rogues.12.3=You wanted to see me.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.34.0=Artifacts?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.23.1=I suppose you've called me to offer an alternate solution?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.12.2=What's with those Rogues? Why are they all chained to the wall by those cables?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.23.0=If we destroy it\u2026 Are you threatening us?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.12.1=Where are you?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.12.0=I thought the rogue Ambassador was Mr Firshe, the one I met at the session.

unity_station_embassy_rogues.22.1=I suppose you've called me to offer an alternate solution?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.22.0=You have a strange object of worship. A giant spaceship that destroys star systems\u2026
unity_station_embassy_rogues.11.0=Brain?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.21.2=I suppose you've called me to offer an alternate solution?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.10.3=You wanted to see me.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.39=I'm glad we've reached an agreement. And remember, human captain: don't forget we need the data! Data about what the Devourer is and what his connection to us is! *Silence. Then the ambassador's voice adds.* The best part of any deal is its conditions being met.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.32.0=Even if I wanted to refuse, my responsibility before my planet wouldn't let me. What do I have to know?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.21.1=You have a strange object of worship. A giant spaceship that destroys star systems\u2026
unity_station_embassy_rogues.10.2=What's with those Rogues? Why are they all chained to the wall by those cables?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.38=*Dry, no emotion in his voice.* Lack of luck or lack of commitment, which is better?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.21.0=If we destroy it\u2026 Are you threatening us?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.10.1=It's very unusual here. Not in a good way, excuse me for being so direct.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.37=I'll transfer the coordinates of four objects to your ship. It's the best preserved ruins of Builder cities, their locations were secret until now. You are going to study them and then you might realize what you have to do next.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.10.0=And where are you?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.36=They're very rare and they can be different. Sometimes it's remnants of ancient cities. Sometimes it's some kind of military structure... some of them still had functioning defense systems, human captain. *Concern.* Be careful.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.35=Usually they only had cultural or historical value, but sometimes we managed to find unusual mechanisms or even weapons... Of course, it's all hopelessly obsolete by now, but there are still those who use it for their ships. Mostly it's Bork pirate captains. They think that Builder weapons bring them good luck.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.34=Everyone has. Especially the Zorsan, since they found most of the ancient artifcats on their planet.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.31.1=Even if I wanted to refuse, my responsibility before my planet wouldn't let me. What do I have to know?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.33=We haven't been able to find out much about the Devourer except that he was made by the Builders, a powerful civilization that lived in this part of the Universe a short time before us. Not short enough for us to meet them, but enough to leave a lot behind. Sometimes we'll find the artifacts of their civilization on this planet or that. Sometimes, the ruins of their cities. Studying everything that's left behind allows us to say for certain that the Builders are not extinct. The Builders left for some other place. The entire people migrated... somewhere, leaving the Devourer here for some reason.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.31.0=So you have some leads? Why don't you follow them yourselves?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.32=The political climate doesn't allow me to have conflicts with the fundamentalists for whom such research is a direct insult to their religious sensibilities. We need an outsider.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.20.0=Well, then?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.31=Precisely. I'm ready to provide you with all the necessary information, you won't have to begin your quest from scratch.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.30=You can't destroy the Devourer, I told you already. But... Maybe... *There's uncertainty in his voice. You wonder if he really feels it or speaks that way on purpose to sound more lifelike.* Human captain, with your determination and talent for finding adventure, maybe you could understand the real Essence of the Devourer, find the place he came from, or even those who made him? It would certainly help save your planet.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.30.0=\u2026and shed some light on the origin of Rogues.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.9=Everything you need is right here, in the ceiling, the floor, the walls... But I understand. The Rogue embassy is unusual even by the standards of the Rogues themselves. However, you better take a seat.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.8=The embassy is me, human captain\u2026 Do you want to continue our conversation standing up?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.7=*The chair is hard, made from some kind of polymers. As soon as you sit down on it, the office changes again: a small holographic projector slides out of the ceiling, gets to work immediately and fills the office with holograms. Furniture, some decorations... the most surprising is the window hologram through which you can see outer space, holographic too. The lights get a little dimmer and now the office is only lit up by the hologram's ghostly blue light.* Hello, human captain. *The voice is still coming from nowhere.* I'm glad to finally meet you.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.6=*The door opens as soon as you walk up to it. You can consider it an invitation. Even if it's dark inside, you come inside, and the light comes on immediately in the ambassador's office. Well, great: the ambassador's office resembles an empty storage room most of all, it's just a mid-sized room with nothing in it except built-in light bulbs.* Human captain. *You can hear the voice from all sides of the office, it sort of enshrouds you.* I suppose you're a little surprised. That's normal. Take a seat. *A chair slides out of the center of the room with a quiet buzz.*
unity_station_embassy_rogues.5=*The Rogue points to one of the doors silently, and there really is a small, almost imperceptible plaque next to it saying 'Ambassador'. The Rogue looks at you waiting for your questions.*
unity_station_embassy_rogues.4=That's right. The embassy is me. *The Rogue is waiting for you to ask something else.*
unity_station_embassy_rogues.3=*The Rogue you walk up to opens his eyes immediately. They're glassy, but you can see rational thought in them. It's a very, very strange combination.* Human captain. You want to know the way to me?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.2=*After you take a closer look you see that the slightly curved pillar isn't here for decoration, its purpose is completely utilitarian. You can see ports for connecting the cables here in there. But at the same time, there is some kind of aesthetics to it, even if unusual for a human.*
unity_station_embassy_rogues.1=*A round hall that looks a lot like the central part of the station. The only differences are the size and the absence of the transparent ceiling: you can't see outer space from this embassy. In general, the Rogue embassy looks a bit... unfit for life, that's exactly how you could describe it. Any creature except the Rogues connected to the walls with cables probably feels a bit out of its element here. Maybe that's why there are so few visitors here?*
unity_station_embassy_rogues.0=*Another big hall, although it's smaller than the previous one. At the center is a big metal obelisk with a few Rogues standing around it, thick cables going from the back of their heads to the obelisk. All the staff Rogues are connected to their posts with cables, other Rogues don't have that. You wonder if they can disconnect those cables. Meanwhile, you can't see the ambassador's office right away. Looks like you're going to have to ask one of the Rogues standing around the obelisk.*
unity_station_embassy_rogues.29=Yes. And even the early descriptions of the Devourer are worrying. They're too accurate. Too close to how it really is. Of course you could say that maybe our ancestors, when on their way to the Mothership, ran into the Devourer in some system on the way. But no. According to our data, even at that point their religion was centered on the Devourer as we know it now. So... Believing isn't the right word here. You can believe in something whose existence isn't proven. You can't \"believe\" in a definite fact. We knew the Devourer existed.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.28=And moreover, we continued building it. *You can hear agreement in his voice.* Nonetheless, we considered the Mothership the only place fit for life, thinking of the rest of space as empty and barren. The Rogues spent too much time flying in their spaceships from wherever they came from. Several generations changed. There were wars and uprisings aboard. We forgot so much.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.27=And now, the interesting part, human captain. Our history is recorded from the moment of settling aboard the Mothership. *A miniature model of the Rogues' Mothership appears in front of you.* We spent thousands of years living in it, at first considering it our world, then venturing outside... All that time, we believed in the Devourer.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.26=Again, several cults, lots of sects. Now the leading religion for the Zorsan is a monotheistic one, according to which all Zorsan are a chosen people created to prosper and rule the Universe.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.25=*The voice continues.* Borks. Many militaristic faiths. By now the Borks have left the concept of religion as such, but nonetheless, we can follow the evolution of their religious views.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.24=Precisely. A little detour into history, human captain. The Klisks. Before they went into space, there were several cults prospering among them based on an idea similar to the Code of Commerce. Of course, they didn't differ much between themselves, and that's why they were easily merged by the Klisks... in essence, their faith didn't change. However, there were the cults.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.23=Not an object of worship. The central object of our faith. The Devourer and his Essence. Unfortunately, it would take too much time and effort to explain the dogmata of our religion, but you can always try to find something out at our Mothership.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.22=No. It is what would happen, and it is very unpleasant for me to talk about it. *You can hear genuine regret in his voice.*
unity_station_embassy_rogues.21=Let us do away with illusions, human captain. Trying to find a way to destroy the Devourer you will not achieve anything. You cannot do it. *The holographic projector paints a picture of a dead Sun.* And even if you did it, my entire people would be forced to declare a holy war on you. After all, you will have destroyed the central object of our faith... *And now, right in front of you is a picture of Earth surrounded by many ships.*
unity_station_embassy_rogues.20=No. Of course not. I've forgotten what that meant\u2026 Nonetheless, I see what you are trying to say.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.19=You're honest. Great. So we can speak frankly.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.18=Of course, I belive you. Nonetheless, even if you're close to finding a solution, we still have things to discuss.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.17=And have you had any success?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.9.1=Excuse me, where are you?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.16=*His voice sounds as if the speaker were nodding.* You don't agree?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.9.0=*sit down*
unity_station_embassy_rogues.15=Exactly. Did you want to ask something else?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.14=Yes. I did. We do have something to talk about\u2026 The Devourer. We know he came to your system. Do you know what that means?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.13=So I can function through them. Don't worry, when their shift ends, they become themselves again. *Smirk.* And also the cables come out of the walls. Or there would be no point in having guards, would there?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.12=Yeah. I insisted the embassy was like this. It keeps the visitors from staying too long.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.11=Like I said, the embassy is me, human captain. The embassy is one big augmentation I have, or rather, judging from the scale, I'm one small augmentation the embassy has. I see through the cameras. I keep the order with the guards. I talk to the visitors through the consultants. And myself... *Smirk.* I am a brain somewhere inside the Unity.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.8.1=Why is it empty in here?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.10=He really is the ambassador. *His voice gets softer, as if the person it belongs to was smiling.* The ambassador of the ambassador, so to speak. He represents me in times where personal presence is needed.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.8.0=*sit down*
unity_station_embassy_rogues.7.4=You wanted to see me.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.7.3=What's with those Rogues? Why are they all chained to the wall by those cables?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.7.2=It's very unusual here. Not in a good way, excuse me for being so direct.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.7.1=Where are you?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.7.0=I thought the rogue Ambassador was Mr Firshe, the one I met at the session.
unity_station_embassy_rogues.6.2=Why is it empty in here?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.6.1=Excuse me, where are you?
unity_station_embassy_rogues.6.0=*sit down*
