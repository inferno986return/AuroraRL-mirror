sstones_after_incident.6.0=Did you try talking to him or something?
sstones_after_incident.10.1=So what do we do with it?
sstones_after_incident.8.0=Maybe you could give me some advice.
sstones_after_incident.10.0=At least now we know the rock is a living being.
sstones_after_incident.1.4=So what do we do with it?
sstones_after_incident.1.3=At least now we know the rock is a living being.
sstones_after_incident.1.2=I've heard some of your people\u2026 weren't so lucky.
sstones_after_incident.1.1=It's a good thing there are no victims.
sstones_after_incident.1.0=It's a good thing there are no victims.
sstones_after_incident.10=Yes. It's a good thing you outfitted the ship with a medbay back then. *Gordon rubs his bruise again.* Some of my colleagues had to be literally sewn together from pieces, but in the end, everyone is alive.
sstones_after_incident.3.1=So what do we do with it?
sstones_after_incident.9=If we can't either reach an agreement or calm that creature down, we better send that creature back to where we took it from. That's all I can say, Captain. You have the last word.
sstones_after_incident.3.0=At least now we know the rock is a living being.
sstones_after_incident.8=I refuse to carry out any experiments on this creature as long as there exists a possibility of danger for me and my people. I'm sorry, Captain. I don't want it to happen again.
sstones_after_incident.7=First it wouldn't respond, then talking got pretty low on our list of priorities. *Gordon looks at the camera. He looks nervous, irritated, his eyes are red.*
sstones_after_incident.6=The soldiers shot it almost clean through. And it's still alive and hitting the walls down there in the cargo hold. I don't think finishing it off will be so easy... at least without endangering the ship. And... can we? I don't approve of its reaction, but it could have just been defending itself. From its point of view we're barbarians and kidnappers. I'm sorry, but it's true, Captain.
sstones_after_incident.5.2=So what do we do with it?
sstones_after_incident.5=*Gordon shrugs.* Hard to say. The rock moved when we were studying it. It could have been a wild animal's reaction.
sstones_after_incident.5.1=Did you try talking to him or something?
sstones_after_incident.5.0=Maybe we should finish it off and perform an autopsy?
sstones_after_incident.4=Alive, yes.
sstones_after_incident.3=A horrible and stupid death\u2026 I\u2026 I never expected that. *Gordon rubs his bruise again.* Althought we all knew what we were signing up for when we came to the Aurora.
sstones_after_incident.2=Yes. And that's miracle. Captain, my people don't want\u2026 that kind of exercise. They're intellectual workers, not physical laborers. *Gordon rubs his bruise again.* At least not always.
sstones_after_incident.1=*Gordon nods.* And then the s-soldiers came. Shot the rock a couple times, it calmed down. It looks alive. *He rubs his bruise.* I ordered to roll it into the cargo hold. It rolls around there from time to time.
sstones_after_incident.7.1=So what do we do with it?
sstones_after_incident.0=*Gordon doesn't look great. All the visible part of his coat is covered with dust and dirt. And there's a bruise glistening on his face. Apparently, head of the Sciene Department ran into something hard while skipping around the lab.* ...that's what happened.
sstones_after_incident.7.0=Maybe we should finish it off and perform an autopsy?
sstones_after_incident.9.1=Okay, I'll think about it. Let it sit in our cargo hold for now. It can't hurt anyone in there.
sstones_after_incident.9.0=Right. Too much hassle. I've decided to throw that boulder into open space. *Open the external airlock in the cargo hold.*
sstones_after_incident.0.0=And all this time you've been running from a stone in the lab?
sstones_after_incident.2.1=So what do we do with it?
sstones_after_incident.2.0=At least now we know the rock is a living being.
sstones_after_incident.4.0=Is it sentient?
sstones_after_incident.6.1=So what do we do with it?
