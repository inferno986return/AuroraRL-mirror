bork_embassy_test_injure.3.1=By the way, speaking of what just happened. I think he was trying to provoke me on purpose. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.3.0=Okay. Good. Let's get to business. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.13.0=That's great.
bork_embassy_test_injure.2.2=By the way, speaking of what just happened. I think he was trying to provoke me on purpose. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.2.1=Punished? Why? I think his wound is enough. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.2.0=Come on now! Things happen. Let's get to business. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.19=Spot? Wow. My eldest son is a pirate. Great. Captain, do you want me to call him back from your planet? I can do it, but Tornur won't like it too much. Maybe you could sort it out yourself? You could do it better than me.
bork_embassy_test_injure.12.0=Hm, yeah, you know\u2026 All right. Let's get back to business. What did you decide? 
bork_embassy_test_injure.18=Slow. That's a good word, but it's too mild. Let's be honest: Tornur is dumb as a brick. What has he done, apart from the blockade? 
bork_embassy_test_injure.17=One of them. You've met two of them, at the spaceport and here. They're twins. And Tornur, that's my eldest's name, he's from my ex-wife. The only child. You do know what that means? 
bork_embassy_test_injure.16=Yep, it is. So that's where he went\u2026 That little brat. *Kartar frowns.*
bork_embassy_test_injure.15=We all have our problems. Well, then, if you have any more business, let's discuss it now. We better handle everything at once. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.14=I think so, too. We'll send you an ambassador in\u2026 a week. Yes. A week. There is no need to escort him, he can get there himself. We will be looking forward to receiving your ambassador.
bork_embassy_test_injure.13=I wouldn't say our cooperation will be very productive at first. After all, we are on very different stages of development. But the analytics department gave us the green light, and the Veteran Council approved their decision. Congratulations. The Borks are honored to work with the humans. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.1.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test_injure.12=Well, you didn't. And in any case, those are just your assumptions. I never confirmed them. *Kartar looks at you with an expression of being undeniably right.* 
bork_embassy_test_injure.11=Who knows? Who am I to try to convince you otherwise?
bork_embassy_test_injure.10=It's precisely the opposite. Nothing wrong with that at all! *Bork hits his desk with his fist so hard it creaks.* You handled yourself really well. You tried to avoid the fight as long as possible, but you put a decisive end to it, although you didn't let it end badly. That's our way of doing things. Any Bork will respect you after seeing it. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.11.0=So this is how it is? Hm. You don't even deny the fact that you would have gladly sent that poor soul to his death? I could have killed him. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.9.1=I'm all ears.
bork_embassy_test_injure.9.0=What's wrong with how I handled myself there?
bork_embassy_test_injure.19.1=No, I don't want to drag it out. Call him back. And if he ever wants to sort out our differences, I'm always at his service. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.0.0=Hello.
bork_embassy_test_injure.19.0=You're probably right. I don't need any enemies among the pirates. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.10.1=So what's the verdict?
bork_embassy_test_injure.10.0=Mr Hrrraka, if I were any more bold, I might have said that you orchestrated that situation\u2026
bork_embassy_test_injure.8.2=Okay, that's all. Let's talk about the main purpose of my visit. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.8.1=The Obliterator? What is that?
bork_embassy_test_injure.8.0=What's wrong with the Klisk Code?
bork_embassy_test_injure.23.1=No, I don't have any more business. I'm glad everything has gone over so well. Until next time. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.23.0=There is something. My planet is being blockaded by a small Bork fleet. Their leader, some named Hrrraka\u2026 Wait. That's your name.
bork_embassy_test_injure.9=Business. Right. I know the purpose of your visit, and I received the information packet sent from your ship. It has been studied attentively. We have already reached a verdict, based on how you handled yourself in the waiting room, among other things. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.18.0=Nothing much, yet. He checks ships out and sends them back to the planet. He said our planet was now, quote, \" his spot.\" He also said smart Borks could give him a different spot. From what I understand, he meant you. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.8=A conflict they provoked has just ended\u2026 And moreover, the Zorsan are a very arrogant people. Consider this a free warning.
bork_embassy_test_injure.7=The Obliterator? You don't know? Oh, I don't want to ruin the surprise for you. *Kartar grins again, but this time there is something mocking about his grin.* 
bork_embassy_test_injure.6=Well, let's think about this together. Universe-class merchants do their deals guided not by logical profit, but by some Code that tells them what to exchange for what. That's stupid. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.5=Hah. If all humans are like you, I can only admire the resourcefulness of your people! *Kartar grins cheerfully.* You are so well informed. What else do you know? Maybe you'll share the secret of the Klisk Code or the mystery of the Obliterator? Or maybe you'll get the Zorsan Emperor to issue an official apology? 
bork_embassy_test_injure.7.2=Okay, that's all. Let's talk about the main purpose of my visit. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.4=With all due respect\u2026 Do you really think you're such an expert on my people that you can speak about our ulterior motives with such conviction? *Kartar smirks.* 
bork_embassy_test_injure.7.1=Apology from the Zorsan Emperor?
bork_embassy_test_injure.3=*Kartar laughs boomingly, but becomes serious again a moment later.* Leave that decision up to me.
bork_embassy_test_injure.7.0=What's wrong with the Klisk Code?
bork_embassy_test_injure.2=I am Kartar Hrrraka, the diplomatic representative of my Republic. I speak for my entire nation when I beg your pardon for what happened in my waiting room. You should know that the Bork, whoever he is, will be severely punished for his actions. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.1=*The Bork gets up and you can see he's over two meters tall. His clothes, which look like a two-piece suit, make him look even wider than what he really is.* Hello to you, too. *He walks up to you and pats your shoulders respectfully. His voice is roaring and content.* 
bork_embassy_test_injure.0=*The Bork Diplomatic Representative's office is very lavish and a bit scary. You get this impression because of the numerous carved elements that are literally everywhere, from top to bottom. The owner himself, apparently, feels right at home in this ambiance, and he looks pretty lively.*
bork_embassy_test_injure.22.0=It'll take too long! But\u2026 okay. I sincerely hope you'll help us. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.17.0=Even if I didn't, it's not hard to guess: Tornur is a bit slow.
bork_embassy_test_injure.6.2=Okay, that's all. Let's talk about the main purpose of my visit. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.6.1=Apology from the Zorsan Emperor?
bork_embassy_test_injure.6.0=The Obliterator? What is that?
bork_embassy_test_injure.21.1=No, I don't have any more business. I'm glad everything has gone over so well. Until next time. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.21.0=I'll be brief: the Zorsan are planning to attack my planet. Any help is welcome. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.16.0=Your son?
bork_embassy_test_injure.5.3=Unfortunately, I'm not that well-informed. Let's talk about the main purpose of my visit. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.5.2=Apology from the Zorsan Emperor?
bork_embassy_test_injure.5.1=The Obliterator? What is that?
bork_embassy_test_injure.5.0=What's wrong with the Klisk Code?
bork_embassy_test_injure.20.1=No, I don't have any more business. I'm glad everything has gone over so well. Until next time. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.15.2=I'll be brief: the Zorsan are planning to attack my planet. Any help is welcome. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.20.0=I'll be brief: the Zorsan are planning to attack my planet. Any help is welcome. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.15.1=There is something. My planet is being blockaded by a small Bork fleet. Their leader, someone named Hrrraka\u2026 Wait. That's your name.
bork_embassy_test_injure.15.0=No, I don't have any more business. I'm glad everything has gone over so well. Until next time. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.4.1=The Klisks shared their intel about Borks with me. I didn't mean to show off my professionalism to you, but\u2026
bork_embassy_test_injure.4.0=Obviously, I was a bit too cocksure. Let's get back to business.
bork_embassy_test_injure.23=I hope so, too, trust me. Do you have anything else?
bork_embassy_test_injure.22=Hm\u2026 That's a difficult situation, I can't promise anything. I'll have the Veteran Council discuss this, send me all the relevant data. 
bork_embassy_test_injure.21=Okay, I'll handle it. Do you have anything else?
bork_embassy_test_injure.20=That's the right decision. Do you have anything else? 
bork_embassy_test_injure.14.0=I can't promise you he'll get here soon.
