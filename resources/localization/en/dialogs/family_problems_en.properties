family_problems.93.0=If you're not saying no, it means yes, right? I know, it's hard for you to accept the truth about the real nature of things, but... trust me, it's worth it. Of course, it's bad to be homeless, penniless, and have no family... but imagine how it is to be a level five operating thetan! Not many people have enough money for more. So, can you dig it? Do you want to hand me all of your money and cargo?
family_problems.20.0=No respect for the faithful. Henry, turn the weapon systems on. We're going to have a battle.
family_problems.100.0=I see you want to hear some more! The levels are reached very easily. Those who want to reach them have to hand me over all of their belongings and money. Well, not to me directly, but... actually, you could say it goes to me.
family_problems.69=ARRRRRRRR!!! YOU'RE NOT DAD!! YOU LIED!! You see now?! Played when you were little... Yeah, right! His favorite game was hitting you with a stick!! *The line goes dead. The brothers approach the Aurora 2, and they don't mean well.*
family_problems.91.0=There are different kinds of operating thetans. Fifteen levels. The higher your level, the more of an operating thetan you are. And being an operating thetan, like I already told you, is wonderful, since an operating thetan doesn't need physical things to act. Does this sound vague to you? That means I've done it!
family_problems.78.1=Let's cut the chit-chat. En garde!
family_problems.68=DAD NEVER ROARED LIKE THAT! Whew\u2026 do you get it now? *The line goes dead. The Borks attack.*
family_problems.78.0=It's a long story\u2026 ahem\u2026 Let's start off with saying that there once was a creature called Xenu. He was the overlord of the Galactic Empire. It existed seventy-five million years ago.
family_problems.67=DADDY!! Shut up! Lots of Borks are pirates. He's lying! NO!! HE'S NOT!! Yes he is!
family_problems.66=WHAT?! YOU'RE NOT DAD! *The line goes dead, the brothers attack. No, seriously, did you really think you guessed that right?*
family_problems.9.1=Hello? Do you read me?
family_problems.65=DAD?!! FOR THEM?!! ARRRRR! *The line goes dead. The brothers attack. You must have made a mistake.*
family_problems.9.0=*keep silent*
family_problems.64=ARRRRRRRRRRR! YOU!!! *The line goes dead. The brothers approach the Aurora 2, and they don't mean well. Well, apparently their dad didn't like trading much.*
family_problems.63=DAD! YOU'RE ALIVE! Shut up, stupid. He's not Dad. He's lying. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?!!! DAD, YOU'RE ALIVE!! IT'S GREAT!! Retard, *the smart Bork states.* And you... aaaaar! If you're our father, come on, tell us about yourself. Who were you?
family_problems.62=Har! Good decision. The ship is in good h- *The alternatively gifted brother's roar drowns him out.* YOU! ME!!! I!!! KILL!!! *After a moment he yells even louder.* LATER!!! LAAAAAAATER!!! *The line goes dead. The smart guy stays next to his father's ship. His brother goes towards the border of the system.*
family_problems.61=ARRRR! SEE?! SEE?!!! IT'S MINE!! MIIIINE!! Yeah, I saw. I won't fight the two of you, but... You, whoever you are. I'll find you. And I'll have my revenge. *The line goes dead. The smart one flies off towards the border of the system. His brother does something with his father's ship.*
family_problems.76.0=Well, I did it. I was good, right?
family_problems.60=DAD SAID WE COULDN'T SELL THE SHIP. Yeah. He said it would be disrespectful. Is this your decision? It didn't help us... *The smart guy sighs, which sounds like a quiet roar.* Well, then. We have to do it, Stupid. *The line goes dead. The Borks start fighting.*
family_problems.7.0=*listen some more*
family_problems.74.0=Um, Henry\u2026 There's going to be a fight! Get ready!
family_problems.5.0=If there's one thing I love about you, Frontz, it's how modest you are. Right. Over and out.
family_problems.72.2=Great, then. Now make peace.
family_problems.72.1=All right. Hand over your cargo and get out of here. Let's call it help from my sons.
family_problems.72.0=Right, then. Get your asses out of here before I get angry.
family_problems.3.2=Thanks for the information, Sarah, but I'm not interested. Over and out.
family_problems.59.0=Don't be a flirt, Sarah. And stop listening in on my personal line. Although\u2026 thanks for calling me sweet. But stop listening in on the captain's line regardless! Over and out.
family_problems.3.1=This is very useful information, Sarah. Veeeery useful. I'll get right to writing up a report about putting you forward to a decoration. Let's say, umm... Order of the Galaxy. 
family_problems.3.0=Give them to me again. I want to know what they're talking about.
family_problems.16.12=My name is L. Ron Hubbard\u2026 and this is a really long story. It's about religion, or a science, called Scientology. Seriously, you won't get it.
family_problems.16.11=The Obliterator. In fact, I don't think you can call me a god. But I'm strong.
family_problems.16.10=Tetragrammaton. Everything is permitted to me. And I really - did you hear? - REALLY like money.
family_problems.70.1=Stupid, stop it. Giving him a scare is enough.
family_problems.70.0=Go on. It's his punishment for not recognizing me.
family_problems.59=Yeah, Cap, you're so sweet! I'm proud of you!
family_problems.57.0=But it doesn't make any sense! Damn it. I couldn't do it.
family_problems.58=THIS... THIS... DECISION. Are you... serious? I... No, I... *The smart one thinks.* Sounds good to me. Really good. I don't want to shoot you, Stupid. I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU EITHER, DUMBASS. HEY. YOU. THANKS FOR YOUR HELP. Yeah, thanks. It's a strange decision, but it's better than... Arrrrr! *The line goes dead. A couple of seconds later, their father's ship flies off towards the star, and the Borks fly off towards the system border.*
family_problems.1.0=I believe you. Is there anything else?
family_problems.57=That's dumb. We'll be too busy for it. AND SMARTASS IS GOING TO COME HERE AND STEAL THE SHIP. Or someone else is. Your decision didn't help us. It's too bad that we have to do it, but... *The line goes dead. The Borks attack each other.*
family_problems.56=Taking apart a great ship like that?! Dad would\u2026 YEAH. DAD WOULDN'T WANT IT. Your decision didn't help us. Right. We don't have a choice. *The line goes dead. According to the radar, the Borks are attacking each other.*
family_problems.55=IT'S TOO SMALL. Yeah. Dad's ship is too small to fit both of us. If that's your decision, it didn't help us. Stupid, get ready for battle. We don't have a choice. ARRRRRR! *They sign off and attack each other.*
family_problems.54=Borks, Captain. Just Borks. *Henry smiles cunningly looking at the camera.*
family_problems.53=ARRR! GOOOOD!! I feel stupid, but\u2026 arrrrr! *The smart brother signs off and flies towards the border of the system. The stupid brother signs off as well and quickly follows him.*
family_problems.55.0=Too bad I couldn't do it.
family_problems.52=REALLY? YOU'LL TAKE IT?!
family_problems.51=*The Bork breathe heavily.* HE'S RIGHT, SMARTASS. DO YOU REMEMBER HOW DAD BEAT YOU? I do. You won't shut up about it. I can't pull that trigger now, Stupid. I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOU EITHER, DUMBASS. But... what about the ship? I... you know... you take it. Maybe Dad really wanted it like that. NO. YOU TAKE IT. IT'S BETTER. Oh come on now. I've made a decision. I don't need Dad's ship. I SAID TAKE IT! No, you take it! YOU'RE ASKING FOR IT!!
family_problems.50=*The Borks are silent, letting you finish.*
family_problems.53.0=That was really weird. Um\u2026 Henry, did you hear that? REALLY weird.
family_problems.51.0=Easy, easy. If neither of you want to take the ship, I can sort that problem out.
family_problems.38.0=You're ready to kill each other over a regular ship?
family_problems.36.0=Nothing. Nothing at all. Damn it! They're attacking!! Liszkiewicz, battle alert! Frontz, uh\u2026 grab onto something!
family_problems.49=WELL?! What is it?!
family_problems.48=STRONG! BRAVE!! KILLED MANY KLISKS!! KILLED MANY ZORSAN!! I have to agree. Dad was stupid, but don't let anyone tell you he didn't know how to fly a ship. HE WASN'T DUMB! HE WAS LIKE ME! Well, that's what I'm talking about... YOU'RE ALWAYS BEING ARROGANT. REMEMBER HOW DAD BEAT YOU OVER THE SPINE WHEN WE WERE KIDS? He beat you over the head! YEEEAAH... GOOD TIMES... *The Borks have a strange concept of family love.* 
family_problems.47=Yeah, me too. *He's smart, but simple. Or is being simple a kind of being stupid?* It's just that I'll just be smart about it! *The Smart Guy keeps silent, waiting for your decision.*
family_problems.46=Haaar! *The Smart Guy roars. Even though his voice isn't as deep as his brother's, it still sounds like a deafening roar.* What is this idiot going to do with a great ship? He'll probably go rob Klisks or the Zorsan. He'll die in the second raid, if not the first one. But I can use it intelligently, I'm not exactly stupid. And after all, Dad loved me more. For one thing, my mother had two kids, so we're both smart. And Dad, even though he was like this one... *The dumber brother roars.*...he never called him anything except Stupid. And me, he called me affectionately... *did he just shed a tear?* Dumbaaaass!
family_problems.45=*The alternatively gifted Bork shuts up, giving you the floor.*
family_problems.44=WEAK. A NORMAL BORK NEVER HAS ROCKETS LESS THAN TWO METERS LONG. WHAT KIND OF ROCKETS DO YOU HAVE?!
family_problems.34.0=Henry, battle alert. Hmmm\u2026 Sarah? Are you on my line again?
family_problems.114.0=You really shouldn't do that. Don't joke about Scientology!
family_problems.43=HA. DAD LOVE ME! WHEN HE HIT ME, HE HIT ME IN THE HEAD. ONLY ONE BONE, SO IT DOESN'T HURT! AND THE SMART GUY GOT IT IN THE SPINE. AND HE LOVE MY MOTHER, NOT THIS SMARTASS'S. HE WAS LIKE ME. AND THIS SMARTASS ALWAYS THROWS HIS WEIGHT AROUND. HIS ROCKETS MUST ONLY BE ONE METER LONG!
family_problems.42=*They don't respond. They must be waiting for a speech.*
family_problems.41=AND WHO ARE YOU?! Yeah! Although\u2026 *The smarter brother thinks for a bit.* That's reasonable. In any case, if something happens, we can take this fool out together. HEY! MAYBE WE'LL TAKE YOU OUT TOGETHER INSTEAD!
family_problems.40=OH YEAH?! TRY TO TAKE IT! Yeah, you try it! *The lines goes dead, the Borks attack.*
family_problems.32.0=Henry, we're going to have a fight.
family_problems.112.0=Hey, think of the kittens. And in fact, I never even threatened them.
family_problems.19.0=Amen. Henry, we're going to have a fight. Battle alert.
family_problems.110.0=Operating. Well, thanks for the money. I'll pick up your cargo. And now, go, tell the rest of your people about my Word. Your priority should be the rich, celebrities, acto- Ahem. You get it.
family_problems.17.0=Right. Well, let's say I tried. Henry, we have a battle alert.
family_problems.88.0=He was a very, very cruel emperor. Many citizens of his empire weren't content with his rule.
family_problems.15.0=Basically, it means that I'm more powerful than the two of you put together.
family_problems.86.0=Again, let's start off with saying that there once was a creature called Xenu. He was the overlord of the Galactic Empire. It existed seventy-five million years ago.
family_problems.13.3=Nobody. I'm already leaving. You guys keep fighting.
family_problems.39=NOT REGULAR! GOOD! DAD'S! And in fact, that ship is far from bad, *the smarter brother concludes.*
family_problems.13.2=I'm your dad. Who else?
family_problems.38=And why did you... *The louder and dumber one talks over his smarter brother.* WE HAD A DAD. STRONG. AND YEAH. HE DIED RECENTLY. AND HIS SHIP, WHOA, GOOD! OOOH! ARRRR! Why are you... AND HE WANTS IT. I WANT IT TOO. AND I NEED IT MORE. No, I do! NO!!
family_problems.13.1=Just passing by.
family_problems.37=What do you want?! YEAH. WHY ARE YOU LISTENING IN?
family_problems.13.0=Who am I? I'm\u2026 hmm\u2026 I'm God. Yeah.
family_problems.36=HA. YOU'RE NOT HIM. YOU'RE TOO SMALL. Yeah. Itty bitty, in fact. LIKE A SPECK OF DUST. A speck of sand. HAHAHAHAHA! Hahahaha! *The line goes dead, and suddenly, you hear Sarah's voice.* Small? Cap, what were they talking about? *She smiles mischievously.*
family_problems.9=*The first voice yells back instantly.* I still remember that! My ship is better! BUT DAD HAD THE BEST SHIP! Yeah! And that's why I want it! I REMEMBER! HE LEFT NOTE! IT SAYS SHIP IS MINE! He couldn't write! Arrr! ARRRRRRR! Arrrrrrrr! ARRRRRRRRRRRRR! *Those Bork cries certainly don't mean anything good. If you don't intervene, there will be a fight.*
family_problems.35=Cap, that was something! Tetragrammaton?! *Sarah shows her pearly whites.*
family_problems.8=*It's hard to say what the next sentence means. The translator can't handle it, and instead of coherent speech you hear barbaric noises of the Bork language. That must have been some especially convoluted insult. After that, there are no problems with the translation.* You're asking for it! I'll tear you apart! *The other voice responds immediately.* I'M OLDER! I'VE ALWAYS BEATEN YOU!
family_problems.34=THERE'S FEAR IN YOUR WORDS!! KILL!! KILL!! KILL!! *He signs off.* Tetragrammaton? What kind of name is that?! *According to the radar, they're both going to attack.*
family_problems.7=*There is another click, Sarah types something quickly, configuring something. As a result, you can hear the Borks much better now. You now realize that there are two voices, even though they're very similar.* Mine! It's mine! I deserve it more!! NO, MINE! ME! MINE!
family_problems.84.0=If you're not saying no, it means yes, right? I know, it's hard for you to accept the truth about the real nature of things, but... trust me, it's worth it. Of course, it's bad to be homeless, penniless, and have no family... but imagine how it is to be a level five operating thetan! Not many people have enough money for more. So, can you dig it? Do you want to hand me all of your money and cargo?
family_problems.33=I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. Me neither. BUT I'LL KILL YOU ANYWAY. For the first time ever I agree with you, Brother. *The line goes dead.*
family_problems.6=Sure, Cap. Just don't make a sound! If you can hear them, they can hear you.
family_problems.32=*The line goes dead. Apparently, the Borks are attacking. Obviously, they decided not to grace your idiotic drivel with an answer.* 
family_problems.5=Without looking too far into the future, I'll say: why an order? *She smiles.* I'll settle for a medal.
family_problems.31=You won't get it!
family_problems.4=Does it even exist?
family_problems.3=This is what's on all of our comm lines. Some Borks are negotiating. They don't think it's necessary to encode it, of course. You can hear it from whichever end of the system.
family_problems.2=There is. *She nods.* Let me show you. *Sarah presses some button, and the previously quiet radio is instantly filled with dense Bork cursing. You can see Frontz laughing heartily, though she has turned off her microphone. She returns the communication line back to normal in a few seconds.*
family_problems.11.0=Nothing. Thinking out loud. And Sarah, please stop listening in on my personal line.
family_problems.1=This thing, fragile? *laughs* You can kill a cow with that. I'm serious, you can.
family_problems.0=Cap? Captain? *Sarah knocks on the camera lens with her finger. The camera shakes.
family_problems.82.0=I'm glad you're listening so attentively. So. There are different kinds of operating thetans. Fifteen levels. The higher your level, the more of an operating thetan you are. And being an operating thetan, like I already told you, is wonderful, since an operating thetan doesn't need physical things to act. Does this sound vague to you? That means I've done it!
family_problems.69.0=I was so close. What a shame\u2026 Liszkiewicz, battle alert.
family_problems.67.2=Hey. Don't you recognize me? Don't you remember how we used to play when you were little? It's me!
family_problems.80.0=No, I'm not. Although... anyway, listen on. There were a lot of protesters. Almost two hundred billion. He took them all to my home planet, killed them with hydrogen bombs, and their souls... uh... how do I put this... he put them into the bodies of the creatures that are now called humans.
family_problems.67.1=I really am your father. I'm a pirate Bork, arrrrrrr!!! Arrrrrr!!!
family_problems.67.0=You, the dumber one, shoot this smartass up. Let him shut up.
family_problems.65.0=I had to try\u2026 Liszkiewicz, battle alert! Power to weapon systems!
family_problems.29=YEAH. HEY, SMART GUY... WE'RE SONS OF OUR DAD, TOO. *The second voice is cautious.* What do you mean by that? HE LOVED US TOO. HE DIDN'T WANT US TO FIGHT. He called you stupid, and me a dumbass. YEAH, HE LOVED US. HE WAS GOOD. Could be. What do you suggest? I DON'T WANT DAD'S SHIP. I WANT TO GO HOME TO MOM. SHE LOVES ME TOO. Right. So... I can take the ship? *The first voice is silent. According to the radar, its owner has jumped out of the system.* Right. Satan, I don't know who you are, but thanks. You got rid of that retard. What a laugh.
family_problems.63.3=I\u2026 well, I solved problems. Didn't matter whose as long as they had money. The Klisk, the Zorsan, the Rogues\u2026 those newfangled humans. Diplomacy, random shuffles, agent work.
family_problems.28=AND WHAT NOW?
family_problems.63.2=A pirate. I robbed whoever I wanted.
family_problems.27=PUNCHING YOUR DAD?! OOOOH. THAT'S BRAVE. *The voice booms approvingly.* WHO WAS YOUR DAD?
family_problems.63.1=A military man. I'd battle with whoever I was ordered.
family_problems.26=Sounded several seconds ago, Captain. *Henry responds because he, as he should, has been on the emergency line for a good while now.* How do you know the lyrics to that mantra?
family_problems.63.0=A merchant. Who else?
family_problems.25=*The Bork processes the lyrics for a couple of seconds. And then he pipes up boomingly.* WHAT THE... ARRRRRRRRRRRR! *He signs off and launches an attack, according to the radar.* You're weird. But I'll be happy to kill you, *concludes the second voice.* 
family_problems.24=HUH?! SING? HM\u2026 *The Bork sniffs quietly.* SING. I LIKE SINGING. Are you out of your mind?! SHUT UP. I WANT TO HEAR A SONG.
family_problems.23=*Henry, who has been listening in on the line for a good while now as he's supposed to do, responds.* Yes, Captain. According to the radar, they're going to attack.
family_problems.22=WHAT?! I DIDN'T GET THAT. He said he, like, likes you. IS HE CALLING ME STUPID?!! Yes. ME?! STUPID?! And a complete retard. And he also said that- ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! *The line goes dead.*
family_problems.21=MORTIF\u2026 MORT\u2026 ARRRRRRR! *Having lost his faith in the world, the stupider brother launches an attack. The smarter one signs off as well and attacks you.*
family_problems.20=MONEY?! TAKE MY MONEY?! YOU\u2026 ARRRRRRRR! *He signs off.* Whoever you are, you're done for. When this retard gets angry, you better hide. And when I get angry, you better save me the trouble and kill yourself.
family_problems.48.3=I think I've made a decision.
family_problems.48.2=Tell me more about your father. What was he like?
family_problems.61.0=Um\u2026 I hope he'll forget about it. And in any case, this solution is better than nothing. Although I could have done better.
family_problems.48.1=All right. You, the one who isn't completely stupid. The smart guy. Why do you need the ship?
family_problems.48.0=Okay. You, with the loud voice. Why do you think you have to get the ship?
family_problems.46.0=So your brother is going to rob and pillage. Aren't you?
family_problems.44.0=Ahem\u2026 Trust me, they're big. But let's not talk about that right now. What else can you say?
family_problems.42.3=I think I've made a decision.
family_problems.42.2=Tell me more about your father. What was he like?
family_problems.19=WHAT DO KIDS HAVE TO DO WITH IT?! I didn't get that, either. It sounded weird\u2026 I think he thinks we're stupid. ME?! I'LL KILL YOU! Go ahead, I'll help you. *The line goes dead.* 
family_problems.42.1=All right. You, the one who isn't completely stupid. The smart guy. Why do you need the ship?
family_problems.18=BLOW ME UP?! ME?! HAHAHAHA. I'LL WRECK YOUR SHIP AND CHOKE YOU!! He'll be dead already. DOESN'T MATTER. *The line goes dead.*
family_problems.29.1=Eh, no. I want that ship, too.
family_problems.42.0=Okay. You, with the loud voice. Why do you think you have to get the ship?
family_problems.17=ETERNAL?! WHAT DOES HE MEAN?! You're dumb. He says he's, like, immortal. OH YEAH?! I'LL KILL HIM THEN. Me too. *The line goes dead.*
family_problems.29.0=You're always welcome. Satan is always there to help, one could say.
family_problems.16=WHAT?! NO ONE'S STRONGER THAN ME! I'M STRONGER THAN EVERYBODY STRONG AND EVEN THE STRONGEST ONES! TELL ME YOUR NAME?!! WHO ARE YOU?!! WHAT ARE YOUR POWERS?!!
family_problems.109.0=This is how it is? Well\u2026 that's not much, of course\u2026 I think level three is enough for now.
family_problems.15=OMNI\u2026 SUPER\u2026 SUPER\u2026 BLAH! *The other voice is silent.*
family_problems.14=UH. WHAT'S A GOD? Uhhhh\u2026 yeah. What's a God?
family_problems.13=AHUH?! WHAT? Shut up. Hey. Who are you? How did you\u2026 oh. Did you turn off the encryption of our comms again, you retard? WHAT'S ENCRYPTION? Shut up. Okay. Who are you and what are you doing on our line?
family_problems.12=*Sarah smiles and signs off.*
family_problems.11=Did you say anything, Cap?
family_problems.40.0=Henry, battle alert! Power to weapon systems!
family_problems.10=*The line goes silent. Apparently the brothers are fighting.*
family_problems.27.0=He created the place where we lived. And he had a whole bunch of friends. When I tried to punch him out, some of his friends wanted to help me... Well, it's a long story. But trust me, I didn't have a choice.
family_problems.107.0=You want to change? It's very easy! You just have to become an operating thetan! There are different kinds of them. Fifteen levels. The higher your level, the more of an operating thetan you are. And being an operating thetan, like I already told you, is wonderful, since an operating thetan doesn't need physical things to act. Does this sound vague to you? That means I've done it!
family_problems.98.0=These free souls that inhabited those creatures' bodies are called thetans. The goal of every thetan is becoming an operating thetan. An operating thetan is a thetan that is capable of acting independently from material things. I don't really understand what it is myself, to be honest... but nevermind. This is not the essence of Scientology.
family_problems.25.0=Just as I thought, they didn't like it. Henry, battle alert.
family_problems.105.0=I'm shocked and amazed that my teaching has reached your soul! Listen on. There were a lot of protesters. Almost two hundred billion. He took them all to my home planet, killed them with hydrogen bombs, and their souls... uh... how do I put this... he put them into the bodies of the creatures that are now called humans.
family_problems.96.0=He was a very, very cruel emperor. Many citizens of his empire weren't content with his rule. You haven't forgotten this, right?
family_problems.23.0=Well, then, battle alert. Not like we have a choice, is it?
family_problems.103.0=He was the overlord of the Galactic Empire. It existed seventy-five million years ago.
family_problems.94.1=Who cares, anyway. We've gone off topic. I need your father's ship, so I'm attacking. En garde!
family_problems.94.0=Got it. Let me start again, then.
family_problems.21.0=Right. Henry, we're going to have a battle.
family_problems.101.0=I know, it's hard for you to accept the truth about the real nature of things, but... trust me, it's worth it. Of course, it's bad to be homeless, penniless, and have no family... but imagine how it is to be a level five operating thetan! Not many people have enough money for more. So, can you dig it? Do you want to hand me all of your money and cargo?
family_problems.92.0=The levels are reached very easily. Those who want to reach them have to hand me over all of their belongings and money. Well, not to me directly, but... actually, you could say it goes to me.
family_problems.79.0=That doesn't matter, trust me. What does is that he was a very, very cruel emperor. Many citizens of his empire weren't content with his rule.
family_problems.90.0=These free souls that inhabited those creatures' bodies are called thetans. The goal of every thetan is becoming an operating thetan. An operating thetan is a thetan that is capable of acting independently from material things. I don't really understand what it is myself, to be honest... but nevermind. This is not the essence of Scientology.
family_problems.77.0=Sarah\u2026 Thanks, but if you listen in on my personal line again, I'll cut your pay. You know I'll do it. Go take care of your direct responsibilities. Over and out.
family_problems.8.0=*listen some more*
family_problems.75.0=I get the ship. Because it's mine. Stupid, give the dumbass a kick, let him get a move on.
family_problems.6.0=Got it. Okay, do it.
family_problems.73.0=Too bad. I was so close\u2026 Battle alert! Liszkiewicz, I repeat! Get ready for battle!
family_problems.4.0=For you, I'll make it happen.
family_problems.71.0=That's right. Henry, battle alert.
family_problems.58.0=I think I can be proud of myself.
family_problems.2.0=So, what was it?
family_problems.56.0=Too bad. But I tried.
family_problems.0.0=Frontz, quit it. The equipment is fragile, you'll break it.
family_problems.54.0=That's true. Right\u2026 Okay. Over and out. We have to go on. Great things await us.
family_problems.39.2=Yeah, I get it. Well, go on, then. Sorry for interrupting you.
family_problems.52.0=It's not an easy decision, but\u2026 what can I do?
family_problems.39.1=Uh\u2026 look, fratricide isn't normal. Let me try to help you decide, at least.
family_problems.39.0=Far from bad? I think I need it more.
family_problems.50.5=Sell the ship, divide up the money.
family_problems.50.4=Why do you even need that ship? Let it be a monument to your father. Or send it into the star. No ship, no problem.
family_problems.50.3=Settle it using some other bet. For example, who robs the most goods in a month. Whoever wins gets the ship.
family_problems.50.2=Why do you have to make it so hard? Take the ship apart and divvy up the spare parts. I think it's a wise decision.
family_problems.50.1=Handle the ship together. A pilot team of two brothers, it's great!
family_problems.50.0=You're brothers, after all. Would your father really want you to kill each other over his ship?
family_problems.37.0=What's the deal here? I'm curious.
family_problems.35.0=Well, I had to surprise them, didn't I? Also, stop eavesdropping. Someday I'll transfer you back to Earth for that. Over and out.
family_problems.33.0=Right\u2026 Those things happen. Liszkiewicz, battle alert!.. Damn it. I feel like a total idiot.
family_problems.113.0=I don't really know, to be honest. Do you want me to tell you about Xenu?
family_problems.16.9=Seth. I have a jackal's head. Although you probably don't know what a jackal is\u2026
family_problems.16.8=Thor. Well, uh\u2026 the power of the lightning! Woooo!
family_problems.31.0=Your funeral. Liszkiewicz, battle alert!
family_problems.111.0=Heh. I didn't think it would work. I must have chosen the wrong career.
family_problems.16.7=Satan. While you obeyed your daddy, I tried to punch mine out. Didn't end too well, but how cool was that!
family_problems.18.0=Stupid Borks. No respect for other cultures. Well\u2026 Liszkiewicz, battle alert. Ready the guns.
family_problems.16.6=Krishna. I don't even know what else to say. I'm good at singing. And I can sing for a long time.
family_problems.16.5=Jesus (Mormon). Well\u2026 I'm good at taking punches in the cheek. And I like stupid people. Oh boy, you can't even imagine how much I like stupid people!
family_problems.89.0=Listen on. There were a lot of protesters. Almost two hundred billion. He took them all to my home planet, killed them with hydrogen bombs, and their souls... uh... how do I put this... he put them into the bodies of the creatures that are now called humans.
family_problems.16.4=Jesus (Protestant). Well\u2026 I'm good at taking punches in the cheek. And I like money. And I like mortifying flesh\u2026 my own, unfortunately. But that won't save you two. 
family_problems.16.3=Jesus (Orthodox). Well\u2026 I'm good at taking punches in the cheek. And I like money.
family_problems.16.2=Jesus (Catholic). Well\u2026 I'm good at taking punches in the cheek. And I like kids.
family_problems.16.1=Allah. Yeah, I'm stronger than you. And I'm good with explosives. There was a time when I was good at science, but now\u2026 I'm good with explosives.
family_problems.16.0=Buddha. I'm, like, eternal, and all that. And I also have a bit of a weight problem.
family_problems.14.0=You don't know? God is the omnipotent, supernatural higher creature. Well, that's me.
family_problems.85.1=Who cares, anyway. We've gone off topic. I need your father's ship, so I'm attacking. En garde!
family_problems.85.0=Oh, that means we're not done yet. I'm always glad to explain it to you again. Well, then\u2026 listen up.
family_problems.99=I\u2026 I CAN'T\u2026 I CAN'T HANDLE IT ANY MORE\u2026 Me\u2026 me neither\u2026
family_problems.98=*The dumb brother cries in misery and, judging from the sounds, hits the dashboard with his head. His smarter relative is silent, but he's breathing much more loudly and heavily.*
family_problems.12.0=*Sigh, pour a little wine in a glass, complain about how hard it is to be a Captain, and get to other business.*
family_problems.97=AAAAARRR! How could we have forgotten?! You said that a minute ago!!
family_problems.96=I DON'T WANT!! I DON'T!! Enough!! Enough!!!
family_problems.95=*The Borks respond with a wild roar*
family_problems.83.0=It's good that you ask! The levels are reached very easily. Those who want to reach them have to hand me over all of their belongings and money. Well, not to me directly, but... actually, you could say it goes to me.
family_problems.94=NOOOOOO!!! You're crazy! You're just out of your mind!
family_problems.93=*The Borks are silent. Obviously, they are being graced with the truth.*
family_problems.92=WHAT?! What?!

family_problems.10.0=So the aliens have inheritance problems, too.
family_problems.90=I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. THETANS?! XENU?! WHAT?! HOW?!
family_problems.81.0=Don't interrupt! I'm not finished. Now we're getting to the basics. These free souls that inhabited those creatures' bodies are called thetans. The goal of every thetan is becoming an operating thetan. An operating thetan is a thetan that is capable of acting independently from material things. I don't really understand what it is myself, to be honest... but nevermind. This is not the essence of Scientology.
family_problems.68.0=I had to try. Henry, power to weapon systems. There's going to be a fight.
family_problems.66.0=No, I made a mistake. Uh\u2026 who am I talking to? Right. Doesn't matter. Liszkiewicz, battle alert!
family_problems.64.0=Henry, Battle alert! Right. Worth a try.
family_problems.114=*Suddenly, without even changing his expression, Henry stars laughing heartily. He barely manages to hit the button to go off the line, he's laughing so hard.*
family_problems.113=What do the kittens have to do with it, Captain? *Liszkiewicz is surprised.*
family_problems.112=*You suddenly hear Henry's voice.* You're a scary man, Captain. *There is so much sarcasm in his voice you could kill a kitten with it.*
family_problems.49.4=You know what? Settle it yourselves. Judging idiots is too hard.
family_problems.111=AS YOU SAY! AS YOU SAY, O GREAT ONE! Glory to you! O, glory to you!! *The Borks go off the line and jump, leaving the system. The really did transfer all their money and drop their cargo.*
family_problems.89=What is this BS?! What is it?! Ron Hubbard, are you crazy or something?!
family_problems.49.3=Neither of you deserve the ship. I'll take it.
family_problems.110=YES!! Glory! Glory to L. Ron Hubbard!! I'M AN OVERAPING THETAN! OVERAPING THETAN!!!

family_problems.49.2=Why do you have to fight over it? Can't you settle it peacefully?
family_problems.62.0=Um\u2026 I hope he'll forget about it. And in any case, this solution is better than nothing. Although I could have done better.
family_problems.49.1=Smart Guy, you can take the ship. You'll handle it better.
family_problems.86=WHAT?! No, wait, that's not what we meant\u2026
family_problems.49.0=The dumb one, you get the ship. You need it more.
family_problems.85=WHAT?!! NOOO! ME DON'T UNDERSTAND! Me\u2026 me\u2026 me either\u2026
family_problems.84=*Silence.*
family_problems.83=WHAT?!! ARRRR! Um\u2026 and how do you reach those levels?
family_problems.82=*The Borks are silent, awestruck after what you just told them.*
family_problems.47.3=I think I've made a decision.
family_problems.81=WHAT?!! What is this drivel?! What's a soul?!
family_problems.47.2=Tell me more about your father. What was he like?
family_problems.80=WHAT?!! What empire? I've never heard about it! What kind of name is that?! You're trying to cheat us!!
family_problems.60.0=Damn it. I couldn't do it.
family_problems.47.1=All right. You, the one who isn't completely stupid. The smart guy. Why do you need the ship?
family_problems.47.0=Okay. You, with the loud voice. Why do you think you have to get the ship?
family_problems.45.3=I think I've made a decision.
family_problems.45.2=Tell me more about your father. What was he like?
family_problems.45.1=All right. You, the one who isn't completely stupid. The smart guy. Why do you need the ship?
family_problems.45.0=Okay. You, with the loud voice. Why do you think you have to get the ship?
family_problems.109=YES!! YES! YES!! BROTHER!! THROW OUT THE CARGO! TRANSFER THE MONEY! ALL HAIL THE GREAT RON! *The brothers cry out in unison.* Yes! Yes, O Great Ron!! Take our money and cargo!! Take our father's ship!! Make us operating thetans!!
family_problems.108=YEEEEEAAAH! *The Bork cries out.* I WANT TO! I WANT TO BECOME AN OPERATING THETAN! Me too!! Me too!! Glory!! Glory to L. Ron Hubbard!
family_problems.43.0=What's wrong with a meter long rocket?
family_problems.107=I DON'T LIKE MYSELF. Dad must not have loved me. I HAVE TO CHANGE. CHANGE.
family_problems.106=YEAH. THETANS. I want to know more!!
family_problems.105=YEAH. AND THEN HE'S LIKE, POW! POW!! GREAT JOB, XENU! GREAT JOB!
family_problems.104=*The dumb brother is silent, and his brother asks a question.* It must have been a great empire, and Xenu must have been very powerful, if people still remember it?
family_problems.103=TELL US ABOUT XENU. WHO IS HE?
family_problems.102=I\u2026 NOT EXACTLY. TELL THE STORY AGAIN. Yeah\u2026 tell us. I think I see some sense in this.
family_problems.101=*The Borks are silent again.*
family_problems.79=WHAT?! What empire?!
family_problems.41.0=You Borks are so sweet. I promise to be impartial.
family_problems.100=THE LEVELS. YOU HAVE TO TELL US ABOUT THE LEVELS. Yeah. There was something about them.
family_problems.78=TELL US OR FIGHT US. Ron? Hubbard? What kind of name is that?
family_problems.28.0=And now my dad and I aren't on good terms. Although they say he still loves me. I'm his son, after all.
family_problems.108.0=The levels are reached very easily. Those who want to reach them have to hand me over all of their belongings and money. Well, not to me directly, but... actually, you could say it goes to me.
family_problems.77=Ooooh yeah, Cap! You sure were!
family_problems.76=*It must be hard when your brother is not only dumber than you, but also stronger. Your radar tells you that the Bork ships are moving towards the edge of the system, and then jump. Only their father's ship is left, unmoved. Rightful booty.*
family_problems.99.0=There are different kinds of operating thetans. Fifteen levels. The higher your level, the more of an operating thetan you are. And being an operating thetan, like I already told you, is wonderful, since an operating thetan doesn't need physical things to act. Does this sound vague to you? That means I've done it!
family_problems.75=YEAH, DAD!!! And what about the ship?!
family_problems.74=YOU BETTER HAND OVER YOUR CARGO, NOT-DAD!!! YOU'RE NOT DAD!!! DAD NEVER TOOK OUR CARGO!!! Finally you get it, retard. *The Bork ships quickly approach the Aurora 2. Their intentions are obvious.*
family_problems.73=WHAT?!! ARRRRR!!! Didn't I tell you?! YOU'RE NOT DAD!!! YOU LIED, YOU LIED!!! WHY DID YOU DO IT?!!! *The Borks attack.*
family_problems.72=OKAY, DAD!!! YEAH!! *The smart one lets out a relaxed sigh, or rather a roar.*
family_problems.71=YOU!! *The Bork roars disappointedly.* DAD WOULDN'T SAY THAT!! Whew\u2026 And now let's kill this liar. OKAY!! *And they launch an attack. You should probably get ready.*
family_problems.26.0=Oh, don't ask. I think we better get ready for a fight. Hare ha\u2026 Damn it, now I can't stop singing it.
family_problems.106.0=These free souls that inhabited those creatures' bodies are called thetans. The goal of every thetan is becoming an operating thetan. An operating thetan is a thetan that is capable of acting independently from material things. I don't really understand what it is myself, to be honest... but nevermind. This is not the essence of Scientology.
family_problems.70=DAD!! I'M DOING IT!! You retard, don't do it! Don't! Right, Daddy, I recognize you now, just tell him not to shoot at me!
family_problems.97.0=Glad to hear it. Listen on, then.There were a lot of protesters. Almost two hundred billion.

family_problems.24.0=As you wish. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. I can do it some more: Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare. Did you like it?
family_problems.104.0=Of course it was a great empire! And about Xenu\u2026 he was powerful, but he was a very, very cruel emperor. Many citizens of his empire weren't content with his rule.
family_problems.95.0=Do you remember? Xenu. He was the overlord of the Galactic Empire. It existed seventy-five million years ago.
family_problems.22.0=I don't think they believed me. Although, the people of Earth didn't, either\u2026 These Borks are smarter than they look. Right, Henry?
family_problems.102.0=Oh. I see you've almost become level one operating thetans! Congratulations! I'm always glad to tell this wonderful story again.
