metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.17.0=Where to now, Matthew?
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.44=*It's still an employee apartment of mediocre comfort. Everything is where you left it.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.43=*[ERROR. Admin's note: Real funny! You know I can't just delete a user profile from here! You're like children. What kind of name is Roger Wilco anyway?]*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.42=*You've found something. In a small text file is a simple table. It lists, with an almost devil-may-care simplicity and precision, how much of the processed resources were sold to the aliens. Sometimes they paid in credits. Sometimes in vehicles, but it doesn't say what it was exactly. Interesting data.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.41=*Yeah, it was obvious. Especially now: Donahue's wallpaper is a picture of his wife and daughter. Well... His work profile, predictably enough, only has work files. Mostly it's boring reports, there are a lot of them: from those describing the output of Uranium mines to those that regulate the routes of street cleaners.*

metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.38=*[PROFILE ALREADY IN USE]. Right, that means you can't get into it.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.37=*A list of work profiles of the town hall personnel opens. So many names\u2026*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.36=*Done.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.35=*You skim the article. This is interesting. Apparently the cost of a trip to Earth from here is so high that it's absolutely impractical for the colonists to go there. Looks like almost none of the colonists who ended up here or were born here have gone back to Earth on their own dime.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.34=*You skim the article. You wonder why a child would need to reload a Bork laser gun. It's heavy and unwieldy, Borks aren't good at making laser guns. Granted, that's more or less what the article says. In the end, the author sums up by saying that if you let your child hold a laser gun, you're a bad parent and you should be ashamed of yourself. Words to live by.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.33=*You skim the article. Sandstorms blah blah blah, be careful blah blah blah, and please don't eat the sand, it doesn't taste good.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.32=*You skim the article. Some kind of official warning that a local active predator has entered its mating season. Looks like this critter can... wow... WOW! Holy Molly! What you've read really shakes you up. You resolve never to wander outside colony limits while the tiger beetles are in mating season.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.31=*News headlines: \"Warning! Tiger Beetle Enters Mating Season!\", \"Sandstorms Expected to Last Another Two Weeks\", \"Teaching your child to reload a Bork laser gun\", \"Holidays on Earth: Too Expensive?\"*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.30=*The computer here isn't bad. It's one of the new models, turns on quickly enough. A regular work station with nothing interesting on it except the ability to access local internet and... oh. What is that? Apparently the town hall building has a shared local network. Anybody can access their work profile using any computer in the building. The important thing is knowing the password.*

metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.4.4=Wow. An armored transport.
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.9=What can you do? We have to. If we wait for weapons and equipment to be delivered from Earth, you're not going to have a colony anymore!
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.4.3=I haven't been to the colony in a long time\u2026 How are you doing? What's changed in these five years?
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.8=Yeah, you're the one who found this planet and helped found the colony, Captain. *Matthew smiles. Now you can see he's missing a few teeth.* I can tell you, you could have found a calmer planet, hahaha! *He guffaws cheerfully, but then turns serious the next moment.* Although, there's a bit of truth to every joke. It was really hard at first. Aggressive flora, fauna, and this weather... you can see for yourself. But we're used to it. Thank God for the shipments from Earth and the aliens we trade with.
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.4.2=Are you sure nothing is going to happen to our shuttle?
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.7=They locked it in, so it shouldn't. Earth vehicles can take these storms. Our magnet anchors, too. However, I have to warn you that if the wind reaches superstorm strength, our anchors will still hold, but your shuttle will get its wings and nose torn off. But don't worry, superstorms aren't common here. The last one was three years ago, but back then we had earthquakes, too. Terrible times, they were!
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.4.1=Why was our request to land approved in such a storm?
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.6=That's nothing, sir, it's more or less let up. Half an hour I wouldn't be able to leave the building, it'd pick me up and carry me away. *Matthew guffaws.* And I'm serious, sir. Six months ago, a soldier in full combat gear swept up. It threw him up one kilometer, and then the wind let up and he fell down. I'm sorry about talking about all this in front of the girl, ma'am, but... *He shrugs.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.4.0=Who are you?
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.5=I'm something like Mr Rich's secretary. *The man smiles and wipes the sweat off his forehead with a glove.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.4=*Through the howl the of the wind, you can't hear the noise from the car that just arrived. Only a couple of honks make you realize it's time for you to get out. The car turns out to be a military armored transport with the weapon systems taken off, and you have to run towards it: the wind is too strong, the sand whips you in the face too hard. When everybody is in -- you, the pilots, the woman with the girl -- the transport starts to move. The man meeting you takes off first his protection suit's helmet, then the mask.* Glad to meet you, Captain. My name is Matthew. Sorry about all this, it's fall, we're having one cyclone after another. *Then he turns to the woman.* Sinn? And Jodie, I suppose? *The woman nods, the girl keeps silent.* We're about to get there and Rich will meet you personally. He said he was sorry, he had an important meeting. *The transport starts and begins moving.*      
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.3=*The shuttle gets thrown around for almost twenty more minutes before it finally manages to land. As soon as it touches the landing pad and stops moving, people wearing anti-exposure suits run up to it, lock in the shuttle's wings and some parts of its hull with magnet anchors. How strong do these storms get if the colonists have to use measures like these? The pilot yells out from the cockpit.* Captain, they've sent a transport for us! It'll be here in a minute!
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.2=*You can't see anything except the weakly glowing airport lights. The wind is howling, sand drums on the hull of the shuttle.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.1=*There's no point in talking, it's too hard to do. You smile and shrug looking somewhat guilty. The woman smiles back and holds the girl tighter.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.0=*Now you see why the colony's radio operator told you to go by the radio beacon. What was he saying about the sandstorm that would be over in half an hour? It's not over yet, it just let up a little. The shuttle is getting rattled side to side. Sometimes you hear you can hear the urgent alarm system barking something in the cockpit. You don't even want to imagine how the woman and the child are feeling. They don't look so hot, but they seem to be holding on.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.2.1=*bear through it and wait for the landing*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.29=*Just what you need after the sandstorm! Probably the best part of this apartment.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.2.0=*comfort the woman and her daughter*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.28=*The fridge is full of brickets of easily digestible protein and mineral water. Just looking at it completely kills your hunger.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.27=*It's mostly low quality popular science, and pretty old at that. You pick up one of the books and flip through it: \"Science is great! And if you don't think so, you can go f-\", you don't feel like going to the next page. Yeah.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.46.0=*to the profile*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.26=*The storm has let up a bit, but everything outside looks like it's in fog: strong wind carries currents of sand back and forth. You can't see anything.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.25=Of course. Have some good rest. *Taking your pilots with you, Matthew walks down the corridor. All you have left to do is walk into the room... well, it could have been worse, right? On the other hand, if this is deluxe, what are the other rooms like? The room is small, and it looks smaller than it is because of badly arranged furniture. There's a military bunk bed by the window, covered with a blanket, also military. Next to the bed is a bedside table, and next to that is a desk with a computer on it, turned off for now. That's not counting the fridge and the bookshelf. From the room you can walk to the bathroom.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.44.5=*go to sleep*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.24=I'll take care of them, too. *Matthew nods.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.44.4=*computer*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.0.2=*bear through it and wait for the landing*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.23=To the employee quarters. *Matthew smiles.* People here won't be able to get back home often enough, so there are places in every building where they can spend the night and wait out the weather. *This service wing looks like some barracks, even if it looks more presentable. True, there are no rows of double bunk beds, but a row of cheap doors is gloomy just the same.* One of the best rooms for you, Captain. *Matthew stops in front of one of the doors and opens it with a key.* Deluxe, you could say, hah. There's TV, infonet... It's like the internet but much smaller-scale. Get some rest. Someone will come for you in the morning.
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.44.3=*bathroom*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.0.1=*look out the window*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.22=Thank you, Captain! *Rich's family join him in his gratitude. The man himself is telling Matthew something. He nods and gestures for you to follow him. He goes to the employee area.* I'm sorry, Captain. *Matthew shrugs.* Rich really loves his family, he really does. He's missed it.
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.44.2=*fridge*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.0.0=*comfort the woman and her daughter*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.21=*What does it cost him to stay as impassive? He turns to his family. You can't see his face, but he's almost definitely smiling happily.* Our captain is right! Business first, rest later... Matthew will walk you, you can wait for me at your quarters. *Matthew nods and walks away, taking Rich's family with him.* Please follow me to my office, Captain. If you want to talk now, we'll talk now. *Rich is going to the second floor. All you can do is follow him there.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.44.1=*bookshelf*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.20=Wow, you do remember me! *The man smiles happily.* But you don't know my name, and don't say you can, we haven't been introduced. I'm Rich Donahue, the secretary manager. And... Captain, I hope you understand... I wanted to have our business meeting right after you got here, but... *Now he's smiling guiltily.* Sinn... Jodie... I haven't seen them in so long... Can we postpone the meeting to the morning?

Captain, at first I wanted our meeting to take place straight after you got here. But now... I can't. I need some time to be with my family. Can we postpone our conversation to the morning? I know it's very important, but...
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.25.1=*bookshelf*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.18=*Matthew has no time to answer.* Nowhere for now, Captain! Sinn! Jodie! *On the stairway is a burly but athletic middle aged black man. The girl screams and runs to him. The man picks her up and holds her.* My daughter, God... Sinn, come here already! *His wife won't move. Tears are running down her cheeks. The man walks up and hugs her. Then he sets the girl down on the floor, walks up closer.* Captain... I hope you remember me. I definitely do remember you.
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.25.0=*window*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.17=*One of the guards in his heavy armor looks absolutely normal: kevlar with metal plates, some kind of Bork beam gun in his hands. The other one... he doesn't have a helmet. The young guy's head is crossed by a terrible scar that's pulsing with an incredible vessel impossible for a human. This vessel is glowing, it's big. If you look closer, you can see the flickering solid parts of something and fibers... augmentation! The soldier squints displeasedly. He doesn't like the attention.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.16=*Standard reception area of a standard third-rate government building. Gray walls, cheap shaggy carpet on the floor, guards at the entrance. You can't focus your view on anything, it's so dry and faceless. The furniture, the secretaries' work desk at the reception, and even the secretatries themselves look like they were taken from the You're Not Welcome 4000 standard kit. Although, the guards... Something's out of place there.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.15=*The sand keeps falling off of you. The shuttle pilots have it best, they're wearing their comm helmets, convenient. And you'll have to wash the sand out of your ears later... but you have more important business to attend to. The town hall.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.14=*Having passed the checkpoint, the armored transport slows down smoothly and stops right in front of the town hall entrance. Matthew puts on the mask again, opens one of the armored transport's doors and runs to the town hall doors. He opens one of them in a way that gives you some cover from the wind and waves at you. What can you do? You're going to have to run!*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.13=Yes, sir. *Matthew points at the window.* Can you see those red and green lights? That's our town hall. Mr Rich ordered me to take you straight here. He really wants to see his family. And to talk to you, of course.
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.12=*Through the windows made out of reinforced glass, you can see some squat thick-walled ouses with flat roofs, some glowing lights, solid surfaces of the roads... nothing else. The wind is still too strong.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.23.1=Thank you, Matthew.
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.11=*A generic Earth-made wheel-mounted armored transport. An old specimen, weird to see them still being used at the colony. Looks like they've only put in some softer seats, otherwise the interior isn't any different from the standard. Ascetic.*
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.23.0=And my people?
metropole_burden_leader_after_landing.10=We have appropriate light transports. But during a sandstorm, we better take this thing. *Matthew slaps the wall with his hand.* Trust my experience, sir.
