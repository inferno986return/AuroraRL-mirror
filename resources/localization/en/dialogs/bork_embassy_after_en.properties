bork_embassy_after.11.1=I think it's because of what happened in the waiting room.
bork_embassy_after.11.0=I don't know! No idea! Stupid day. Stupid planet. Stupid Borks. 
bork_embassy_after.9=Could be. The Borks like deciseviness and violence, Captain. You didn't show either. 
bork_embassy_after.8=Why do you think that?
bork_embassy_after.7=Well, that's better than nothing. A half-empty glass is half-full. 
bork_embassy_after.4.0=You said it yourself: that Bork wasn't acting like a normal Bork. And then, talking to the Diplomatic Representative, I realized he was behind it all. 
bork_embassy_after.6=The people he's working for are very lucky, then. 
bork_embassy_after.5=*Henry understands instantly.* So you think it was some kind of test? The Diplomatic Representative wanted to see your reaction to... to what? 
bork_embassy_after.14=Maybe our relationship with the Borks will get better in the future. 
bork_embassy_after.13.0=You approve of his actions? Wow. I'm not going to say anything, I'll think about it when I ahve a minute, but\u2026 See you, Henry. 
bork_embassy_after.4=What do you mean?
bork_embassy_after.13=In that case, the people he's working for are lucky. 
bork_embassy_after.3=Congratulations, then, Captain. Earth will be happy.
bork_embassy_after.12=I think so, too. The Borks like decisiveness and violence, but you didn't have to kill that Bork. 
bork_embassy_after.6.0=You think so? I won't argue with you, I have business to attend to. I think you do, too. 
bork_embassy_after.2=Great, Cap. How did you manage that?
bork_embassy_after.11=That's really bad. Why\u2026 *Henry stutters.* couldn't you? 
bork_embassy_after.1=How did it go?
bork_embassy_after.10=You'll have time to think about it, Captain. I have to go to the barracks. 
bork_embassy_after.0=*None of your people are asking you anything. Either they're giving you time to rest, or they don't feel comfortable doing it in front of the Borks. Henry approaches you at the Aurora.* Are you okay, Captain? 
bork_embassy_after.8.0=Because of talking to that big wig. I have a feeling that he was behind it. It could have been a test. One I didn't pass, obviously. 
bork_embassy_after.1.2=Terrible, Henry. I don't think we can hope to work together with the Borks. 
bork_embassy_after.1.1=So-so. We did agree to cooperate, and they're sending their ambassador to us soon\u2026 But apparently that's the most we can achieve for now. 
bork_embassy_after.1.0=Better than what I expected. Earth and Sypsyar are officially working together now. We also signed an agreement about exchanging ambassadors. The Borks will send theirs in a week.
bork_embassy_after.10.0=See you, Liszkiewicz.
bork_embassy_after.3.0=They'll have a reason. All right, Henry. Go back to your room. We both have a ton of work to do. 
bork_embassy_after.12.0=He attacked me, and I was defending myself. I think the Diplomatic Representative was behind it. 
bork_embassy_after.5.0=That's what I don't understand. My reaction to violence? To danger? Maybe to strange behavior of a typical stupid Bork? It's hard to understand. I only know the representative is very cruel. Although he's pretty easy to talk to. 
bork_embassy_after.14.0=I hope it does. All right, Henry, I have to go. 
bork_embassy_after.7.1=That's true, but I think it's all because of what happened in the waiting room. 
bork_embassy_after.7.0=Yeah, that's what I think, too. But it could have been better. I wonder where I screwed up. 
bork_embassy_after.9.0=I guess I learned my lesson\u2026 I have to go. So do you, I think. 
bork_embassy_after.0.0=More or less.
bork_embassy_after.2.1=It's because of what happened in the waiting room.
bork_embassy_after.2.0=I guess I was good in there. And the information about Earth\u2026 We have to give a bonus to whoever composed that packet.
