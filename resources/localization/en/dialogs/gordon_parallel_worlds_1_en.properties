gordon_parallel_worlds_1.5.5=I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.5.4=Hm. And that's all you can tell me right now?
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.5.3=Gabe?
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.5.2=Tell me about the third phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.5.1=Tell me about the second phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.5.0=Tell me about the first phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.4.0=Tell about the experiment itself in more detail.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.10=That is c-c-classified information. I\u2026 just can't tell you anymore. 
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.3.0=Did you know about the world we've been in?
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.2.1=Like the one we were in THAT time? I mean, ahem\u2026 you remember. 
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.2.0=Tell about the experiment itself in more detail.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.9=He was\u2026 Old school. A true scientist, very determined and smart. I r-r-respect him a lot. He probably works in complete secrecy now. And the third phase will have gone through by now. Without me. 
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.8=Phase three. Gabe went off the radar and the experiment was closed. It became completely classified. The third phase meant subjecting a human being to the physical environment of a different world. It would have been... *Gordon sighs musingly* wonderful. 
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.7=Phase two. The effects of foreign-world physical conditions on different kinds of animals. It was a great breakthrough for some medical technologies, such as, uhm... implanting, mostly, and classic cloning. Resetting the cell division counter.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.6=Phase one of the experiment. The effects of foreign-world physical conditions on inanimate objects. We didn't receive any results that could be applied practically, so Gabe authorized proceeding to phase two. 
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.5=Three ph-phases. And our boss, Gabe\u2026
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.4=*Gordon shakes his head no.*
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.3=Yes! Yes! That world isn't parallel to ours, that isn't even a real term. It's just, sometimes they get weaker... *Gordon tries to explain something to you using his hands.* You won't understand... some bonds get weaker, and you can invade those worlds! The objective of the experiment I took part in was researching the effects that those worlds had on different objects from our world. 
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.10.4=I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.2=I said\u2026 Worlds with different physical conditions. You called them parallel worlds, but it's not true! They aren't like that! They aren't related to our dimension in any way, they're completely different! 
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.10.3=Gabe?
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.1=*He nods cautiously in response.*
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.10.2=Tell me about the third phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.0=*Gordon shuffles nervously.* I told you\u2026 it's classified.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.1.0=Which means you can tell me something, after all. I have to know what you did before, don't I? 
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.10.1=Tell me about the second phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.10.0=Tell me about the first phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.9.4=I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.9.3=Hm. And that's all you can tell me right now?
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.9.2=Tell me about the third phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.9.1=Tell me about the second phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.9.0=Tell me about the first phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.0.0=But you did tell me something last time.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.8.4=I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.8.3=Hm. And that's all you can tell me right now?
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.8.2=Gabe?
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.8.1=Tell me about the second phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.8.0=Tell me about the first phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.7.4=I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.7.3=Hm. And that's all you can tell me right now?
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.7.2=Gabe?
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.7.1=Tell me about the third phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.7.0=Tell me about the first phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.6.4=I think I've gotten enough information.That's all for now.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.6.3=Hm. And that's all you can tell me right now?
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.6.2=Gabe?
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.6.1=Tell me about the third phase.
gordon_parallel_worlds_1.6.0=Tell me about the second phase.
