metropole_burden_discussion_end.4=All right, great. *Rich smiles.* I shudder to imagine what my people would do to me if they found out you wouldn't come to the press conference! *He guffaws.* Someone will take you to the room where you spent the night. I hope you have enough time to get some rest. *Rich nods and shuts the office door.*
metropole_burden_discussion_end.4.0=I hope so, too. This conversation hasn't been easy.
metropole_burden_discussion_end.3=*Your business here is done. The farewell takes a lot less time than than the greetings. Rich obligingly walks you to the door of his office and shakes your hand, adding at the last moment:* Even though we're done with our business, you're still going to have to stay here until the evening: you should do a press conference with me. The colonists will be happy to see you, Captain. You're a hero, after all.
metropole_burden_discussion_end.2=What is our result here? *Rich's smile is sad and sardonic.* Nothing but wasted time, Captain. You've come here in vain. I talked to you in vain.
metropole_burden_discussion_end.1=*Rich sighs with relief: the conversation has tired him considerably. He wipes the sweat off his brow and says grumpily:* Better watch out with you, Captain, huh? You pushed a little too hard at times... but I understand, those are the orders you got on Earth. The conversation is over, and in a way, we've reached a compromise. I'm glad.
metropole_burden_discussion_end.0=Well, then. *Rich is tired, but he looks pleased with the conversation nonetheless.* This conversation hasn't been easy. I didn't expect it from you... I underestimated you, Captain! And still, I'm glad we've reached an agreement, a compromise.
metropole_burden_discussion_end.0.0=I'm glad we did, too.
metropole_burden_discussion_end.1.0=I'm glad we did, too.
metropole_burden_discussion_end.2.0=It's sad.
metropole_burden_discussion_end.3.0=How can I say no, then?
