family_problems_ship.1.0=Is there anything useful there?
family_problems_ship.2.1=Too bad. And to think they raised such a ruckus over it.
family_problems_ship.2.0=And what if we send a crew of volunteers over and have them fly it to Earth themselves?
family_problems_ship.3.1=Too bad, but okay.
family_problems_ship.3.0=Damn it. If I'd known, I wouldn't have gotten involved at all.
family_problems_ship.3=Impossible, Cap. Since we don't have any blueprints or manuals, it would take years to study its controls, make them suitable for human use, and learn to fly it more or less safely.
family_problems_ship.2=Almost nothing, Captain. Bork technology is similar to ours, there won't be any breakthroughs from studying it. We've taken some materials and a few interesting things, but there wasn't anything serious on board. Maybe they'll get some more out of in on Earth, but we can't take the entire ship with us, it's too big.
family_problems_ship.0.0=Well?
family_problems_ship.1=Despite our high expectations, it's a typical Bork pirate ship: fast, but weak and armed only with rockets. And it's pretty worn, too. The only thing that sets it apart is a whole compartment used as a... greenhouse! The previous owner grew some kind of herb here. Unfortunately, it didn't survive all the hardships the ship's been through.
family_problems_ship.0=Captain, we have studied the Bork ship we got.
