bork_planet_default.12.0=All right. I'll keep that in mind.
bork_planet_default.0.3=I just came to say hello, I'm already leaving.
bork_planet_default.9.1=But that's a travesty! Why won't the other races do something about them? 
bork_planet_default.0.2=The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. Can you help us somehow? 
bork_planet_default.9.0=Were they like that with you, too?
bork_planet_default.0.1=When we got to the Zorsan planet, they lured us in and attacked us. Why did they do it? We never did anything bad to them. 
bork_planet_default.0.0=There is something. A Bork fleet led by someone named Hrrraka has blockaded my planet. That Hrrraka told me to talk to some, and I quote, \"smart Bork.\" 
bork_planet_default.12=As long as the Zorsan aren't a serious threat to you, we don't have a reason to intervene. But if it comes to total war between your species, it will all depend on our cooperation. If it goes well in the future, we can aid you. 
bork_planet_default.11=No one needs it. Us, the Klisks, the Rogues and some others have shown them that we can take care of ourselves. But that came at a great price. In a space war, there usually are no victors, but the are losers. No one wants any more destruction. It's easier to just let it be. 
bork_planet_default.10=Yes. We've had several wars, the last one ended in almost complete destruction of our capital. But we hit them pretty hard, too. Well, it's the same with the rest of them: The Klisks, the Rogues. They've picked fights with everyone. 
bork_planet_default.2.1=No, I don't want to drag it out. Call him back. And if he ever wants to sort out our differences, I'm always at his service. 
bork_planet_default.2.0=You're probably right. I don't need any enemies among the pirates. 
bork_planet_default.4.0=Okay, you can't help us, then. 
bork_planet_default.6.0=Great!
bork_planet_default.11.0=So it would be stupid of us to expect you to support us? 
bork_planet_default.8.0=Well, then\u2026 Sorry for taking up your time. I have to go. 
bork_planet_default.9=The Zorsan are like that with everyone. They think other races aren't worthy, so they try to enslave whoever they can and destroy whoever they can't. The Borks are bandits and murderers? Hah, compared to the Zorsan we're pretty sweet. 
bork_planet_default.8=They won't. *The Bork's eyes look tired rather than intelligent now. He is bored.*
bork_planet_default.1.1=Nothing much, yet. He checks ships out and sends them back to the planet. He said our planet was now, quote, \"his spot.\" He also said smart Borks could give him a different spot. From what I understand, he meant you. 
bork_planet_default.7=I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to deny your request. The Borks have just gotten out of a conflict with the Zorsan. The war hit us pretty hard, we don't need another one. If the Zorsan find out about us helping you - and it's impossible to hide something like that - another conflict is inevitable. 
bork_planet_default.1.0=Nothing much, yet. He checks ships out and sends them back to the planet. He said our planet was now, quote, \"his spot.\" He also said smart Borks could give him a different spot. From what I understand, he meant you. 
bork_planet_default.6=The Veteran Council has authorized military intervention against the Zorsan if they threaten our partners. And our civilizations are getting along great so far. We will send military help if the Zorsan attack your planet. 
bork_planet_default.5=The Zorsan\u2026 We've had our share of wars with them, like a lot of other people. 
bork_planet_default.4=Hrrraka? *Kartar lets out a strange roar.* Never heard of him. I have no idea about how I could help you. Apparently, your planet is blockaded by pirates. I'm very sorry, but... *Kartar bares his teeth meaningfully.* 
bork_planet_default.3=All right, I'll send him a message.
bork_planet_default.3.0=Great.
bork_planet_default.2=Spot? Wow. Captain, do you want me to call him back from your planet? I can do it, but Tornur won't like it too much. Maybe you could sort it out yourself? You could do it better than me.
bork_planet_default.1=Hrrraka\u2026 What has he done apart from the blockade? 
bork_planet_default.0=*The Bork Diplomatic Representative's office is very lavish and a bit scary. You get this impression because of the numerous carved elements that are literally everywhere, from top to bottom. The owner himself, apparently, feels right at home in this ambiance, and he looks pretty lively.* I'm listening.
bork_planet_default.5.1=So will you help us?
bork_planet_default.5.0=So will you help us?
bork_planet_default.10.0=Why doesn't anyone do anything about them? If you unite, you could win and force them to be more respectful. 
bork_planet_default.7.0=But wait, what if the Zorsan decide to attack you after the war with the humans?
