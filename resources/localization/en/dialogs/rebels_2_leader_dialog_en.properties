rebels_2_leader_dialog.20.0=I'll try to remember that.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.9.2=Unfortunately, I won't. I'm going to have to decline.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.9.1=I have some more questions.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.9.0=I'll do it. Long live the revolution, right?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.8.0=The system. What about it?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.7.0=I get it. But you're not finished.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.6.0=That's from my planet's literature. Doesn't matter. What was that about the convoy?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.5.0=Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Tell me some more details, and then I'll decide.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.4.0=It's okay. I see you have an ambitious plan.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.3.0=Why are you looking at\u2026 Oh, that's what it is.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.2.0=*prop yourself against a wall and wait some more*
rebels_2_leader_dialog.99=Well, what is it?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.1.0=\u2026
rebels_2_leader_dialog.0.0=*it's obvious that you better wait*
rebels_2_leader_dialog.19.4=Okay. I've made a decision.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.19.3=It's all pretty serious. From what I can see, you are pretty well financed. Why don't you hire some better mercenaries?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.19.2=About the revolution. Honestly, I still don't get what you're fighting for. Why? Against what?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.19.1=It's a strange question, but tell me about yourself. If we're going to work together, I'd better get to know you well.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.19.0=About the convoy. How do I found out what system it's going to?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.22=Well\u2026 that's too bad. In that case, goodbye, human captain.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.18.4=Okay. I've made a decision.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.21=But\u2026 no. I'm not going to ask you why, that's your business. I'll just ask you if you're going to change your mind. We really need your help.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.18.3=Are there going to be soldiers on the ship? You were talking about deaths like it was nothing\u2026 It's your people. Don't you feel sorry for them?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.20=Long live the revolution! *Folie pats you on the shoulder.* We'll pay the expenses when you complete the mission, of course. Remember, you're fighting the good fight!
rebels_2_leader_dialog.18.2=About the revolution. Honestly, I still don't get what you're fighting for. Why? Against what?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.18.1=It's a strange question, but tell me about yourself. If we're going to work together, I'd better get to know you well.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.18.0=About the convoy. How do I found out what system it's going to?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.17.5=Okay. I've made a decision.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.17.4=Are there going to be soldiers on the ship? You were talking about deaths like it was nothing\u2026 It's your people. Don't you feel sorry for them?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.17.3=It's all pretty serious. From what I can see, you are pretty well financed. Why don't you hire some better mercenaries?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.17.2=About the revolution. Honestly, I still don't get what you're fighting for. Why? Against what?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.17.1=It's a strange question, but tell me about yourself. If we're going to work together, I'd better get to know you well.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.17.0=About the convoy. How do I found out what system it's going to?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.16.5=Okay. I've made a decision.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.16.4=Are there going to be soldiers on the ship? You were talking about deaths like it was nothing\u2026 It's your people. Don't you feel sorry for them?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.16.3=It's all pretty serious. From what I can see, you are pretty well financed. Why don't you hire some better mercenaries?

rebels_2_leader_dialog.16.1=It's a strange question, but tell me about yourself. If we're going to work together, I'd better get to know you well.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.16.0=About the convoy. How do I found out what system it's going to?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.15.5=Okay. I've made a decision.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.15.4=Are there going to be soldiers on the ship? You were talking about deaths like it was nothing\u2026 It's your people. Don't you feel sorry for them?

rebels_2_leader_dialog.15.0=About the convoy. How do I found out what system it's going to?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.19=*Folie looks away, and looks back in a moment. His face is tense, his eyes are angry.* I don't feel sorry for the soldiers, kill 'em until there's no more, and then we'll see. You can't avoid death in a war. And sometimes you have to get dirty for the common good. You never end up clean in this business.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.18=Better mercenaries are unreliable, and you have an axe to grind with the Empire. And you underestimate yourself. You're considered a pretty good military captain.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.17=Hm\u2026 I\u2026 I'll think about what you just said.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.14.2=What kind of motto is that? It's not a creed, it's twaddle. It's so thin it's see-through..
rebels_2_leader_dialog.14.1=Hm\u2026 I don't know what to say. You'll know better.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.16=Maybe you're right.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.14.0=Nice motto. I approve, I think.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.15=I'm glad you understand me.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.14=No. There's people smarter than me. I think about all that, and I know it's all good and well, but... Personally, my motto is \"kill Imperial scum until there's no more of 'em, and then we'll see.\"
rebels_2_leader_dialog.13=Oh! *Folie puts his finger up.* That's a good subject, it's important. If you want it written all smart-like, I'll tell the propaganda department to send the information right to your ship. And if you want the simple version, I'll tell you yourself. *He breathes in and starts talking, as if he were making a speech.* What are we fighting for? For a Zorsan without inequality, where the rich man can't oppress the poor. And the noble ones can't oppress the simple folk. Us, the everyday Zorsan, have to unite into a class, and become a big, powerful force. To show the system what's what! And then, when we've showed them, it can't be like it is now. And then everyone can live free, like all free people.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.12=It really is a strange question... Although... I don't even know what to tell you. I'm an engineer, Folie isn't my real name. I got involved in the revolution because of my convictions. I hate the Emperor. *Folie frowns when he tells you this.* What else? Look... let's trade life stories later.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.11=If you don't have the money and you aren't afraid of getting into a fierce fight, you can get to the Zorsan system on the right day, follow the convoy, and then calculate its destination from the hyperjump parameters. If you do have the money, try to find something out with the Klisks. Or you could try your luck and try to guess the system. I don't think you'll be able to do it, but... *Folie shrugs.*
rebels_2_leader_dialog.10=Yeah?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.13.0=Hm\u2026 Did you come up with that yourself?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.99.2=Unfortunately, I won't. I'm going to have to decline.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.12.4=Okay. I've made a decision.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.99.1=I have some more questions.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.12.3=Are there going to be soldiers on the ship? You were talking about deaths like it was nothing\u2026 It's your people. Don't you feel sorry for them?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.99.0=I'll do it. Long live the revolution, right?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.12.2=It's all pretty serious. From what I can see, you are pretty well financed. Why don't you hire some better mercenaries?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.12.1=About the revolution. Honestly, I still don't get what you're fighting for. Why? Against what?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.12.0=About the convoy. How do I found out what system it's going to?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.11.4=Okay. I've made a decision.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.11.3=Are there going to be soldiers on the ship? You were talking about deaths like it was nothing\u2026 It's your people. Don't you feel sorry for them?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.9=*He shakes his head no.* We don't know anything. You're going to have to find it out yourself. This is how it is. So, will you do it?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.11.2=It's all pretty serious. From what I can see, you are pretty well financed. Why don't you hire some better mercenaries?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.22.0=Goodbye. Good luck to you.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.8=Of course. The convoy. The convoy goes from the shipyard to a colony system. They deliver supplies, weapons, troops. If you destroy the convoy, the system will be defenseless against us. And then we can do some work there! And then we can handle the shipyard!! You get it, right?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.11.1=About the revolution. Honestly, I still don't get what you're fighting for. Why? Against what?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.7=All right. *The map again. You can see a picture of a giant industrial neighborhood.* All of this is the His Imperial Majesty's Shipyard Construction Complex. It's a gigantic factory that makes ships. Now, because of the war, it's in constant crunch mode. Modernization, repairs, building new ships... Ooh! Lots of stuff. *Folie waves his hands, changing the map's output to some other information.* All that doesn't matter. What does is that the thing consumes stupid amounts of resources. And if you stop supplying it... boom! Slack period! And if you do some good work with the people, too... Boom, again! Protests! Demonstrations! Get it?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.11.0=It's a strange question, but tell me about yourself. If we're going to work together, I'd better get to know you well.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.10.5=Okay. I've made a decision.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.6=Okay. What's \"State of Denmark\"? *Folie says it with a horrifying accent.*
rebels_2_leader_dialog.10.4=Are there going to be soldiers on the ship? You were talking about deaths like it was nothing\u2026 It's your people. Don't you feel sorry for them?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.5=That's right. *Folie nods and shows you the data on the map.* Look. The people of Zorsan are grumbling about yet another war. They're unhappy, you see? And to add to that, His Imperial Majesty issued an order recently, and it talks about longer work hours and the cancelation of some benefits. Just like Lando said: \"The people are like a blaster. All you have to do is pull the trigger.\" Well, we're pulling it. And I offer you to take part in it. Not for free, of course.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.10.3=It's all pretty serious. From what I can see, you are pretty well financed. Why don't you hire some better mercenaries?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.4=Can he do it? *Folie thinks for a bit and says.* Of course he can. And if he can't, that's just the first phase. We can afford to screw it up.  *This isn't the end of the discussion. But the conversation between the Zorsan becomes too Zorsan for you to follow. And that goes on for an endless five minutes. You don't want to listen to that, do you? Let's skip ahead to the important part.* I'm sorry that it took so long, you walked in on a meeting.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.21.1=No. I don't want to fight in someone else's war.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.10.2=About the revolution. Honestly, I still don't get what you're fighting for. Why? Against what?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.3=What do we start with, then? *Folie waves his hand, cutting off everyone trying to get a word in. Apparently, he's talking to himself. He studies an interactive electronic map carefully, and a small list next to it. He's pointing his finger and whispering something. In the end, he declares loudly.* Convoy! The convoy from the shipyard! We have to find out which system it's going to. *He clenches his fist.* And then, when we destroy it, we can start an operation in the system. Are you up for it? *The Zorsan are saying yes. Folie continues.* And now that's it's going so well, I propose we give this mission to our new comrade!
rebels_2_leader_dialog.21.0=I think\u2026 I think you're right, I was too hasty. I still want to clear up some things, though.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.10.1=It's a strange question, but tell me about yourself. If we're going to work together, I'd better get to know you well.
rebels_2_leader_dialog.2=*One of the Zorsan shakes his head.* I'm not sure, but it's your call, you're the boss. However, there won't be another chance. Take the recent financing... And also the discontentment of the people. A good operation will not only cripple the operations of the shipyard, it'll also provoke demonstrations on Zorsan! *Everyone nods in approval. Another Zorsan comments.* If we act, we'll have to go big. It is possible that there will be a lot of blood. *Folie adds immediately.* That's bad. But, when all is said and done, we're risking ourselves, too. And we're doing it for them, so that they have a better life! They can't shoot all of us. We... we'll win!
rebels_2_leader_dialog.10.0=About the convoy. How do I found out what system it's going to?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.1=*Folie answers. His voice is firm, but you can tell the leader of the rebels is a bit confused.* I... Yeah, I'm not saying no. It's the perfect time to do something, because, that order, for example... And the recent saboteur attack at the nuclear recycling plant... It must have stirred the people, worked them up. But hitting the very center of the military-industrial complex? Are you sure?
rebels_2_leader_dialog.0=*You are led to the navigation room again. This time, Folie looks more presentable, you could even say he's in uniform. He's discussing something with other Zorsan, and he laconically suggests you wait. Speaking of the Zorsan: there are three of them, and they all look similar, as if they were roughly chiseled out of stone. They all smell of war. It's so strong that Folie looks like a civilian next to them.* ...it's tense, and we have to act, you see? Now, when there's a martial law order signed by His Imperial Majesty... *the Zorsan saying this shakes his head* The people are like a cocked blaster. You only need to pull the trigger.
