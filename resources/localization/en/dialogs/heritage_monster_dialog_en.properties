heritage_monster_dialog.20.1=There is another way.
heritage_monster_dialog.20.0=Of course you could. Stay. We'll find a place for you.
heritage_monster_dialog.9=I... *It frowns.* I forgot it. I remember what it was about. About how tired I was. That I only have what I have in my head, what I think about. I'd like to throw everything I have at someone's feet, someone I can talk to. But all I have is what's inside my head.
heritage_monster_dialog.8=Poetry. Sometimes it appears in my head. And I write it down. And then I forget it again. That's why I write it down.
heritage_monster_dialog.7=*The creature opens its mouth. Then the creature closes it. It falls silent and retreats into itself.*
heritage_monster_dialog.6=It's a space ship. What's wrong with it?
heritage_monster_dialog.5=*No response.*
heritage_monster_dialog.4=So tired. Always alone, always alone. *The creature points at its head.* And there... very bad. *Now it points at its chest.* Here, too. Better all the time, it's unbearable. I wanted to kill myself, but I can't. I thought you would.
heritage_monster_dialog.3=As far as I can remember, I spent all my life on that planet. A very long time. And then you came. That's it.
heritage_monster_dialog.2=*The creature hugs itself and rocks side to side.* I don't know. I don't remember anything.
heritage_monster_dialog.1=I can. *The creature looks up at the camera. It's talking loudly, obviously thinking that you can hear it better that way.* What do you want from me? *It really does look more like a Klisk alive than its comrades when they were dead. If you took a normal Klisk, made it four times as big, grew its muscles until they looked grotesque, and threw a hide of a different color over all that, you would get this monster. Although, can you really call it that?*
heritage_monster_dialog.0=*They brought the monster to one of the cargo holds and set up a direct connection to the bridge.*
heritage_monster_dialog.22=*The monster doesn't respond. Rocking side to side more and more, in the end it relaxes fully and drops to the floor.*
heritage_monster_dialog.21=Yes... No... You don't understand. *It rubs its nose again.* I didn't mean I knew that... it's different... *The monster shudders, and suddenly says in one breath...* Hexatomic structures allow synthesis of nucleotides that are alternative to ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides. Ribo- and deoxynucleotides, nucleotides containing hexose residue, can be bound to each other forming various polynucleotide chains. That... that...
heritage_monster_dialog.20=Humans. Very interesting. *Rubs its nose.* I think I could help. I\u2026 I know\u2026
heritage_monster_dialog.19=Oh. Stay here? And\u2026 who are you? And why?
heritage_monster_dialog.18=Oh?
heritage_monster_dialog.17=Strange. Something is itching in my head\u2026 *It rubs its forehead.* There, inside. But I wouldn't mind that.
heritage_monster_dialog.16=Oh\u2026 What are they like?
heritage_monster_dialog.15=Oh. Ethical\u2026 unethical\u2026 I think I\u2026 Understand. *It hugs itself again and starts rocking back and forth.*
heritage_monster_dialog.14=What do you do with me?
heritage_monster_dialog.13=Yes. I see. I must be a problem. I remember a long time ago, where I lived, small and big things lived. *Tries to depict something with its hands.* I ate them. Then I ran out.
heritage_monster_dialog.12=Really? Why?
heritage_monster_dialog.11=It's just inside my head. That's that.
heritage_monster_dialog.10=I knew that. But I forgot. Now I remember. They weren't like me, you're wrong. They couldn't\u2026 do what I did. *It frowns and rubs its forehead.*
