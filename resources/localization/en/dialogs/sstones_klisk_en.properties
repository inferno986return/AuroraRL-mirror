sstones_klisk.24.0=\"We're like that. You aren't.\"
sstones_klisk.13.1=Weird. Such vibrant colors.
sstones_klisk.14=For your eyes only, human captain. The creature you've delivered perceives it all as literally its body parts... we'll never understand it.
sstones_klisk.13.0=Why are we the dull spots?
sstones_klisk.13=*The Klisks don't pay you much attention and are having a lively conversation among themselves.*
sstones_klisk.12=Aura? *The Klisk doesn't understand.*
sstones_klisk.34.2=\"Hey, wake up!\"
sstones_klisk.9.0=Oh\u2026 it's all so\u2026 uhm\u2026 unusual.
sstones_klisk.11=We're living beings, we reflect its radiation. *One of the Klisks explains this while looking extremely important, but not arrogantly.* Because of that it sees us as dull silhouettes that cannot be analyzed fully. However! *The Klisk adjusts and changes something, more colors appear on the screen.* If we crank up the equipment's sensitivity, we can see that if it wants to, that creature can even see our own radiation!
sstones_klisk.23.3=\"Living beings. Like you.\"
sstones_klisk.34.1=\"Greetings, creature!\"
sstones_klisk.10=*And it really is very unusual. On one of the screens of the terminal, the biggest one, there's an incoherent mess of light and various colors. The more self-colored ones glisten weakly and outline the walls and the floor with a sort of film. Diverse vibrant flashes represent lab equipment. Spots, much duller but also much bigger, move around and pulse. You can make out bulges one of them has, they look like... hey! They're arms and legs!*
sstones_klisk.23.2=\"I don't understand.\"
sstones_klisk.34.0=\"Hello.\"
sstones_klisk.23.1=\"You're in space, the human and Klisk peoples greet you. Who are you?\"
sstones_klisk.23.0=\"Peace. Don't be afraid.\"
sstones_klisk.12.0=Nevermind. I understand you.
sstones_klisk.33.2=\"Hey, wake up!\"
sstones_klisk.8.0=Is that\u2026 is that safe?!
sstones_klisk.22.3=\"Living beings. Like you.\"
sstones_klisk.33.1=\"Greetings, creature!\"
sstones_klisk.22.2=\"I don't understand.\"
sstones_klisk.33.0=\"Hello.\"
sstones_klisk.22.1=\"You're in space, the human and Klisk peoples greet you. Who are you?\"
sstones_klisk.22.0=\"Peace. Don't be afraid.\"
sstones_klisk.11.0=Ahem. Our aura or something?
sstones_klisk.32.2=\"Hey, wake up!\"
sstones_klisk.7.0=Are you sure it won't hurt it?
sstones_klisk.21.3=\"Living beings. Like you.\"
sstones_klisk.43.0=I got that already. Let's\u2026 where is my shuttle docked?
sstones_klisk.32.1=\"Greetings, creature!\"
sstones_klisk.21.2=\"I don't understand.\"
sstones_klisk.10.3=This is all good and well, but can I talk to it?
sstones_klisk.32.0=\"Hello.\"
sstones_klisk.21.1=\"You're in space, the human and Klisk peoples greet you. Who are you?\"
sstones_klisk.10.2=Radiation? Wait. We're in space that has its own radiation, on a spaceship that has its own\u2026 isn't the rock supposed to feel a bit... umm... a bit uncomfortable?
sstones_klisk.21.0=\"Peace. Don't be afraid.\"
sstones_klisk.10.1=Weird. Such vibrant colors.
sstones_klisk.10.0=Why are we the dull spots?
sstones_klisk.6.0=Yeah, you too. *wait*
sstones_klisk.31.0=\u2026
sstones_klisk.20.0=\"We won't hurt you.\"
sstones_klisk.5.1=*wait*
sstones_klisk.5.0=You almost done?
sstones_klisk.41.0=Looks like I'm going to have to be a teacher. Deliver this thing to the Aurora, and be careful.
sstones_klisk.30.0=*Run!*
sstones_klisk.4.0=\u2026
sstones_klisk.3.1=I can't. Unfortunately, I don't have that kind of money on me. I think I'll talk to you when I have it.
sstones_klisk.3.0=Okay, okay\u2026 I'll transfer the money, just help me talk to that rock.
sstones_klisk.2.0=Isn't that too much?
sstones_klisk.1.0=Yes. I think it could help resolve some issues we have.
sstones_klisk.0.0=That's right. It's a\u2026 uhm\u2026 a living rock. It's hard to believe, but that's true.
sstones_klisk.43=We'hope you can handle it, human captain. The task that awaits you is not easy.
sstones_klisk.41=*The Klisk clicks ironically.* Not wait, human captain. It's work, hard work! You're going to have to teach this creature practically by yourself, slowly getting to more and more complex subject matters. It only depends on you how long it takes.
sstones_klisk.39=You wouldn't have anyway. You can't have full-fledged conversations with all creatures right away. You have to get to know it first, it has to get to know you and, of course, the translator has to adapt to the difference in your perceptions. You've set the course for the adaptation, and now the creature will understand you better. But it's still nowhere near normal communication.
sstones_klisk.38=\"Very high... Very high. Above rollers. Above emptiness with bugs. Higher... Very high.\" *There are very few untranslated symbols now, just a couple of lines. One of the Klisks walks up to the terminal and states softly.\" Look, human captain: this creature's alpha rhythms have changed a lot. It's tired and sleeping.
sstones_klisk.37=\"No. No. Not him.\"
sstones_klisk.36=\"What?\"
sstones_klisk.35=Human captain! *The terminal operator clicks nervously.* Stop, please.
sstones_klisk.34=*Nope. The rock won't answer.*
sstones_klisk.33=*No answer again.*
sstones_klisk.32=*Aaand\u2026 there is no answer. Simply none.*
sstones_klisk.31=*It didn't end too well, although there were no casualties. No one was let into the lab after that, but even standing behind the heavy door you could hear the rock roll around and crush delciate equipment to bits. And whereas at the Aurora you managed to calm it down somehow, the Klisks had to open the lab hatches and the stone got sucked out into space. That's how it was over. The only thing there is to add is that the Klisks didn't ask you to cover the damage, but didn't refund what you already paid either.*
sstones_klisk.30=*The rock rotates around itself and... bam! The science terminal is shut off. It smells strongly of burnt plastic. The rock rotates again and begins moving towards you. It looks like even if it woke up, it's not in a good mood. You should run.*
sstones_klisk.9=*The Klisks can't hear you. They're crowding around the research terminal and clicking loudly, speaking fast. It looks like they've managed to do something.* Human captain! *One of them, apparently the boss, motions you to come up.* Come here! You have to see it!
sstones_klisk.8=The pin or the rock? *The scientist controlling a small robot that's hammering the pin in clicks, laughing.* Don't worry, human captain. You saw it, we've tried many things, right? In this case... *He grunts, squeezing the remote violently.* We need... *The robot gives the pin two strong hits, the metal rod disappears inside the rock.* A different approach! It's done! Turn it on! *One of the Klisks performs a solo on the keyboard and... Bam! The air is suddenly full of dust and ozone. What is this strange feeling? Wow. Your hair stood up under the uniform.*
sstones_klisk.7=*You even have to send for food to the Aurora because it's taking too long. Tired Klisks are reduced to methods that look primitive even to a human: one of the scientists is hammering some kind of pin into the rock, with cables leading from it to the research terminal.*
sstones_klisk.19.3=\"Living beings. Like you.\"
sstones_klisk.6=*A Klisk floats past you and clicks annoyedly, snapping something about \"dumb barbarians with no respect for\u2026\" No one except him pays you any attention.*
sstones_klisk.19.2=\"I don't understand.\"
sstones_klisk.29=*The rock moves again, but this time the distance is more impressive. There is interference on the screen. There still is no answer.\"
sstones_klisk.5=\"*It really wasn't easy, you were right to give them the five credits. The rock was dragged to the Klisk lab (a very unusual place
sstones_klisk.19.1=\"You're in space, the human and Klisk peoples greet you. Who are you?\"
sstones_klisk.28=*The rock raps on the metal floor, shakes from side to side. The Klisks jump back, but it doesn't go farther than a few scratches on the floor. There is no answer.*
sstones_klisk.4=*The Klisk nods.* We're waiting for you onboard our ship, Captain.
sstones_klisk.19.0=\"Peace. Don't be afraid.\"
sstones_klisk.27=\"Lightdark, small. Them. Lightdark, big. You. Bugs, too.\" *Another big block of untranslated symbols, but much smaller than before. At the end, a question.* \"Where?\"
sstones_klisk.3=The price is right! *The Klisk looks a bit offended.*
sstones_klisk.26=\"Bugs.\"
sstones_klisk.2=We could try, human captain. The klisks have never met aliens like that, but our methods allow communication even with creatures that simply cannot perceive carbon-based life forms. We'll try. *The Klisk rubs his hands.* Five credits.
sstones_klisk.29.2=\"Wake up already!\"
sstones_klisk.25=*There is no coherent answer. Obviously, the rock didn't understand you.*
sstones_klisk.1=*The Klisk clicks suspiciously, but that is the only indication of how sceptical he is.* I see, human captain. And... and you want to talk to it... as I understand?
sstones_klisk.29.1=\"Greetings, creature!\"
sstones_klisk.24=\"Lightdark. Lightdark. Lightdark\".
sstones_klisk.0=What? An unusual alien?
sstones_klisk.18.2=\"Hey, wake up!\"
sstones_klisk.29.0=\"Hello.\"
sstones_klisk.18.1=\"Greetings, creature!\"
sstones_klisk.23=\"Who? Many. Weird. Who? Many. Weird. Who? Many. Weird. Understand.\"
sstones_klisk.18.0=\"Hello.\"
sstones_klisk.22=*The rock shivers. The text output window is filled with many pages of disjointed letters and numbers. The Klisk operating the terminal clicks politely.* Speak simpler, human captain, it simply can't understand you. *On the screen, you can see the words that have already been there: \"Who?\", \"Many,\" \"Weird.\"*
sstones_klisk.21=\"Hurt? Hurt? Hurt? Hurt? Hurt? Hurt?\" *There are fewer random symbols now, the word that has been translated already is now translated differently.* \"What is that?\" *Symbols, symbols again.* \"Who?\", \"Many,\" \"Weird.\"
sstones_klisk.20=\"Afraid? Afraid? Afraid? Afraid? Afraid?\" *Another string of random symbols.* \"What?\"
sstones_klisk.28.2=\"I repeat, wake up!\"
sstones_klisk.39.0=And how long do I have to wait?
sstones_klisk.28.1=\"Greetings, creature!\"
sstones_klisk.28.0=\"Hello.\"
sstones_klisk.17.0=Got it. So what do I do?
sstones_klisk.27.2=\"Sky.\"
sstones_klisk.38.0=But we haven't talked about anything!
sstones_klisk.27.1=\"Space.\"
sstones_klisk.27.0=\"Very high.\"
sstones_klisk.16.0=Yeah, laugh, you.
sstones_klisk.37.0=\"Very high.\"
sstones_klisk.26.0=\"Bugs?\"
sstones_klisk.15.0=Seriously?
sstones_klisk.36.1=\"Sky.\"
sstones_klisk.36.0=\"Very high.\"
sstones_klisk.25.0=So what do I do?
sstones_klisk.14.1=I guess you're right. It doesn't make sense for me.
sstones_klisk.14.0=Hey, speak for yourselves.
sstones_klisk.19=*The rock vibrates noticeably. The images on the screen get a bit duller. In the small text output window, an incoherent mess of symbols appears. However, there are three words you can make out: \"Who?\", \"Many.\", \"Weird.\"*
sstones_klisk.18=*The Klisk hands you a keyboard. It has the Klisk alphabet on it, and it's very similar to its Earthside counterparts, it's pretty easy to make sense of.* Talk. You enter the text, send the text. The equipment does the rest.
sstones_klisk.17=*The operator of the terminal answers obligingly.* We'll try to do something, human captain. You'll be able to talk and it'll even understand you... but you're too different, too unlike each other. You'll have to be very careful with your words, since at the least it might misinterpret you, at most, attack you.
sstones_klisk.35.1=It's always like that! \"Hey, wake up!\"
sstones_klisk.24.2=\"We're a different form of life.\"
sstones_klisk.13.3=This is all good and well, but can I talk to it?
sstones_klisk.16=*The Klisks click in irresistible silly laughter.*
sstones_klisk.35.0=God, okay, okay\u2026 \"Hello.\"
sstones_klisk.24.1=\"Different.\"
sstones_klisk.13.2=Radiation? Wait. We're in space that has its own radiation, on a spaceship that has its own\u2026 isn't the rock supposed to feel a bit... umm... a bit uncomfortable?
sstones_klisk.15=*The Klisks nod in agreement.* Yes. We think that this is what explains the incident that happened onboard your ship. Having found itself among so many objects radiating electromagnetic waves, your alien simply lost it and became hysterical. Or it was sleeping and tumbling about.
