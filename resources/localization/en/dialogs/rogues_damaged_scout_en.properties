rogues_damaged_scout.24=*The Rogues looks at you through the static pleadingly.*
rogues_damaged_scout.23=N-no, of course not. Just talk. Well, maybe submit them to some psychological test. But only if they agree!
rogues_damaged_scout.22=Miss Frontz, as an engineer, is probably more qualified to tell you about the danger of flying to their ship. I can only say that I would very much like an opportunity to talk to people of that race face-to-face. Especially when they can't leave\u2026
rogues_damaged_scout.21=Well, Cap, going by my estimates, they'll need 10 resource units to patch over the main breaches. We could send it over with a drone, so that we don't endanger our shuttle crew. Or we could try to take them out of there on our shuttle, but that's dangerous, their ship could go boom at any moment.
rogues_damaged_scout.22.1=Got it. Connect me with their ship again.
rogues_damaged_scout.9.1=Hm. You know what, I'll disconnect for a bit. Don't go anywhere.
rogues_damaged_scout.22.0=Gordon, are you trying to tell me you want to experiment on them?
rogues_damaged_scout.9.0=Right. Tell me, how do I help you?
rogues_damaged_scout.0.1=What does the code mean?
rogues_damaged_scout.0.0=Yeah, yeah, I remember, hot. It's us again.
rogues_damaged_scout.8.1=Hm. So the Borks really wanted your cargo?
rogues_damaged_scout.21.0=Gordon, your opinion?
rogues_damaged_scout.8.0=Wow. That's hardcore. How do I help you?
rogues_damaged_scout.9=*There is some static. From the word fragments you can hear, the answer is yes.* \u2026eaning to attack us yourself?!!
rogues_damaged_scout.8=Those dumbass Borks!!! Three flying tin cans made out of trash and crap!! They tried to ram us!
rogues_damaged_scout.7.1=I have to disconnect for a bit. I'll be right back. Over and out.
rogues_damaged_scout.7=What do you think?!! Help us!!
rogues_damaged_scout.7.0=Sure. How do I do it?
rogues_damaged_scout.6=All right, all right!! Heavy transport, bioactive materials, medicine, medicinal narcotics... I don't remember it myself!!! I don't know!!! Help us!!!
rogues_damaged_scout.5=What?! What a stupid question! Why now?!
rogues_damaged_scout.4=We only have one working compartment! The rest are full of vacuum, there's no air! Don't do it! Try to pass our coordinates to some nearby station instead!
rogues_damaged_scout.3=Just do something already! Please!!!
rogues_damaged_scout.2=There are several hull breaches! We need to fix them, at least for some time, to let us get to our equipment!
rogues_damaged_scout.1=The generator is busted! The normalization system has frozen, the main generator is going to blow up soon! And our life support is at minimum, to boot! We're all at the cargo hold, we've turned off service to all other rooms, but we still really need help! Please! We may only have hours left!
rogues_damaged_scout.0=*the connection is very bad* Unknown ship?! Unknown ship?! Help code, hot! Help code, hot! I repeat, help code, hot! Help code, hot!
rogues_damaged_scout.6.2=What? The reception is really bad! I can't read you! I'll disconnect and take care of the line, wait a bit.
rogues_damaged_scout.6.1=Pipe down. Is the cargo valuable?
rogues_damaged_scout.6.0=Yeah, of course. Come on, tell me what's wrong with your ship.
rogues_damaged_scout.5.2=No reason. Look, there are some\u2026 problems. Yeah, problems. I'll disconnect for a bit. Over and out.
rogues_damaged_scout.5.1=Look, I asked you a question. Answer it and don't waste our time. The sooner you answer, the sooner we'll be done.
rogues_damaged_scout.5.0=Damn it, you're right\u2026 What happened to your ship?
rogues_damaged_scout.4.2=Tell me again what happened to your ship.
rogues_damaged_scout.4.1=All right, all right! I'm coming to the nearest station. Hold on in there.
rogues_damaged_scout.4.0=Uh, no. You said you only had hours left yourself. So get ready. I'm sending the shuttle. Over and out.
rogues_damaged_scout.3.2=I need to disconnect for a second to ask my officers for advice. Over and out.
rogues_damaged_scout.3.1=Tell me again what happened to your ship.
rogues_damaged_scout.3.0=Only one solution springs to mind: we could try to get to you on a shuttle and evacuate your ship.
rogues_damaged_scout.24.2=Tell me again what happened to your ship.
rogues_damaged_scout.24.1=Damn it. I don't have the resources. Any ideas?
rogues_damaged_scout.24.0=Right\u2026 I have the resources you need. I'm sending them to you on a drone. Hold on in there.
rogues_damaged_scout.2.0=Gordon, Sarah, what do you say?
rogues_damaged_scout.23.0=Your call. Connect me with the Rogues again.
rogues_damaged_scout.1.2=How did that even happen, guys?
rogues_damaged_scout.1.1=Hm\u2026 Your ship is big. Is it military or a transport ship?
rogues_damaged_scout.1.0=Of course, I'll try to help. What do you need?
