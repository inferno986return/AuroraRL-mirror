metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.1.1=I hope he's had a pleasant evening with his family.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.1.0=What's wrong with your last name?
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.9.0=You know why I'm here.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.0.1=You were wrong, Mr Wilkes.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.0.0=Not at all, Matthew.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.8.1=You know why I'm here.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.8.0=How was meeting the family, Rich?
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.10.2=I'm embarrassed, but I haven't read the documents. What are we talking about?
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.10.1=Rich, to be quite honest with you, I'm sorry but I don't care. You have to sign these papers because that's what our bosses are telling you to do.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.10.0=It's not the Aurora Project that needs it, it's Earth, Rich. I don't understand your motive.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.7.0=I'll try, Matthew. *enter*
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.10=That's right... *Donahue is distracted by a notification noise from his tablet. Glancing at the screen, the secretary manager pushes the tablet aside. Must have been something unimportant.* First they tried asking me, then they tried pressuring me... and now they sent you. And my family. You know, I was really afraid they would try to pressure me through them, but... I guess back at the Aurora Project they thought that if you came personally, Captain, and with my family along, too, I would... *Rich Donahue screws up his face.* ...go soft... right... and agree to sign it?
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.9=Wonderful... *He smiles softly, looking at the family picture, his eyes a little glassy. It only lasts a couple seconds. Now, he's staring at you hard again.* By the way, thank you for agreeing to put off this conversation. It meant a lot to me. Time when I could forget everything even for a little bit... *He shakes his head.*
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.8=*Well, here's the office. Rich Donahue gets up from his desk and greets you.* Captain! Glad to see you. The night was pleasant, I hope? Actually, why I am asking you? I know it wasn't! *Rich guffaws, slapping his desk lightly.* We don't have the best interiors, Captain. *Even a cursory glance is enough to see that Donahue's office is tasteless and provincial. Standard furniture, standard decoration, standard... absolutely everything. Even the massive wooden desk doesn't look imposing in these surroundings, more like goofy. The family picture, half-turned so both the person behind the desk and the visitor can see it, doesn't look sweet. It's a strange sight.* Well, Captain... speak.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.7=As you wish, Captain. *Matthew quickly leads you to the second floor of the town hall, right to the office with the plaque that says RICH DONAHUE, SECRETARY MANAGER.* This is you, Captain. Be gentle with our Rich. *Matthew smiles.*
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.6=Haven't you looked out your window? No, it's not over, but it's calmed down significantly. Now there's just a strong wind. And sand.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.5=Why, is it better at the Aurora? *Matthew smiles like he just told the best joke in the world.* I'm sorry, Captain, this is just the way we live here. And your men spent the night at the barracks. I think they didn't complain.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.4=Yeah, he's missed them a lot. Now he's going to have a much better time here.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.3=Great. In that case, let's move out, Captain. Rich is waiting.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.6.2=Yes, I understand. Let's not keep him waiting.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.2=Even if there's a little over five thousand inhabitants here, that's still not much. Many people know each other so well they're used to never using last names. I constantly forget to introduce myself fully... but with you, turns out I didn't forget. *Matthew smiles.* I'm getting better!
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.6.1=This is some room, I must say. If you consider this deluxe, where did my men spend the night?
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.1=Did I tell you my last name? *Matthew squints.* I must have\u2026 Yeah. Doesn't matter, Captain. Let's go, Rich is waiting.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.6.0=I hope he's had a pleasant evening with his family.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.0=*Next morning, led by some instinctive hunch, you get up early enough to clean yourself up on time. You've barely had enough time, Matthew is knocking on your door already. All you have to do now is let him in.* Good morning, Captain! I thought I was going to have to wake you.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.5.2=Yes, I understand. Let's not keep him waiting.
metropole_burden_discussion_begin_normal.5.1=Is the storm over?
