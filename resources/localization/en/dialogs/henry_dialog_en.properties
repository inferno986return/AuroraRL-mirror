henry_dialog.5.0=Doesn't matter. Blood isn't cheap. We aren't Wild Geese. And I'm not Bob Denard. The mission of our ship is completely different.
henry_dialog.7.0=I don't know. But his offer was lucrative, wasn't it? It's hard to say no.
henry_dialog.0.0=What did you want?
henry_dialog.2.0=I'm listening.
henry_dialog.4.1=No. It's not worth the trouble.
henry_dialog.4.0=Yes. We're going to work for these rebels.
henry_dialog.6.0=Hm\u2026
henry_dialog.8=That's true. It's hard to say no. And war, it's just controlled violence. *Henry looks at you weirdly, but since you're having a video conversation, it's hard to say what exactly he's feeling.* Don't forget, Captain, you're the boss. Be responsible. *He salutes you and signs off.*
henry_dialog.7=Do you think you did the right thing?
henry_dialog.6=*Henry smiles. It's the first time you see him do it, and it's very bright. It's kind.* I'm proud to serve under you, Captain. *He's silent for a bit, then he adds.* I really am. *He salutes you and signs off.*
henry_dialog.5=Oh. I thought you'd say yes. Their proposition really does look lucrative, Captain.

henry_dialog.4=Did you say yes or no?
henry_dialog.3=I'm glad you understand. And I hope you'll answer a question I'm going to ask you.
henry_dialog.2=Sorry. I won't appeal a fine or even time in the brig. However, let me ask something.
henry_dialog.1=We were scanning the station while you were there. Their defenses aren't the best, so I managed to eavesdrop on some parts of your conversation. Sorry.
henry_dialog.0=*Henry calls you. His clothes are pressed, and he is well-groomed as always.* Captain. Do you have a minute?
henry_dialog.1.1=I understand. It's better to be safe than sorry..
henry_dialog.1.0=That's not what an officer is supposed to do, Henry. We were having a private conversation.
henry_dialog.3.0=I'm listening.
