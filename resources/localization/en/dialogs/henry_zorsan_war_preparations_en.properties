henry_zorsan_war_preparations.1.0=That's not what I mean. Are we ready for the war?
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.9=Are you going to put me in front of a shooting squad? 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.3.1=I have to agree.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.8=Exactly. You see? What do you think, are we ready? Is being realistic inappropriate here?
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.3.0=We'll will anyway.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.7=Don't worry, being realistic is a privilege of having a high rank, heh. *Henry smirks.* Being like that is our duty. You wanted to know if we're ready? Well. We'll have to do battle with an enemy who probably has already had experience in combat in space. Maybe even more than once. Whereas we don't have that experience, and even if we did, the only long-range fighting craft we have is... 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.6=You do. Never say die, though. There's always a chance\u2026Is there anything else, Captain? 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.5=Oh, of course not. I'm completely honest\u2026 You know, the subject has dried up. Is there anything else, Captain? 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.5.1=No, you can get back to your duties. Over and out. 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.4=Yeah. Sure we will. *Henry nods.* 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.5.0=Yes. There is something.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.3=Humanity has gone through slaughtering itself more than once. You can call it a sort of military masturbation, doing it by our lonesome. *Henry smiles sarcastically, looking at you askance.* Now we're going to have our first space conflict. We've never battled in deep space before. And to add to that, we only have one long-range fighting ship, the Aurora 2. Well, you still think I'm being too grim?  
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.10=What else do I have left? We're facing a war with an enemy who's probably been in more than one space war, whereas we don't have that experience, and we only have one fighting craft: the Aurora 2... What do I have left apart from jokes? 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.2=Us? *Henry smirks.* We're ready. But we don't know anything about the enemy's technological level or military potential. Considering what I've seen so far, it's not going to be easy. 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.10.1=I have to agree.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.1=Is the connection faulty? No? I said, too bad. *Henry repeats it more loudly.* On the other hand, it's logical. 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.10.0=We'll will anyway.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.0=Too bad.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.7.0=The Aurora 2.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.0.2=Okay. In that case, I have a different question. 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.9.0=You're joking. The dossier didn't say you were a joker. 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.0.1=That's not what I mean. Are we ready for it?
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.0.0=What?
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.2.2=Subversive talks, Liszkiewicz? Well, I'll be. 
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.2.1=That's grim, but being realistic is always good.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.2.0=You're being too negative. Humanity has gone through war more than once.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.4.0=Is that sarcasm?
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.6.1=No, nothing. Over and out.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.6.0=Yes, of course.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.8.1=I have to agree.
henry_zorsan_war_preparations.8.0=We'll will anyway.
