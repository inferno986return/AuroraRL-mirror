unity_station_embassy_bork.9=When we need something from you, trust me, you'll be the first to know. *The Bork bares his teeth again.* Although 'when' may not be the right word, I'd rather say \"if\"\u2026
unity_station_embassy_bork.8=They'll want something, you can be sure of that, and you'll know what to do then, you're not a stupid creature.
unity_station_embassy_bork.7=My esteemed colleagues think the Earth won't hold out against the Zorsan... *The Bork chuckles and bares his teth.* They think different on Sypsyar, and when the Zorsan get it, trust me, they'll try to settle it peacefully.
unity_station_embassy_bork.6=*The Bork roars quietly.* That's the operative word, to talk... to talk... I know that other ambassadors have called you, except the Zorsan one, of course, but when my colleague finally starts to think straight, he'll realize that it's better to try to mend your relations... the ambassadors called you because they wanted something from you, and I actually want to talk because we really do have things to discuss: your colony, your war, your problem with the Obliterator, and of course the Gardener.
unity_station_embassy_bork.5=You're one on one with the most developed people of the inhabited Universe, although you did manage to beat back their biggest attack, so... war of positions, are the Zorsan capable of it? *He speaks quietly, thinking out loud.* They really are, it's your problem after all, no one is going to help you, and if they are... *The ambassador smiles weakly.* Would I believe it if someone told me that one of the civilizations is going to help you now? Of course not...
unity_station_embassy_bork.4=I like to stay informed about the situation at the fronts\u2026 *The Bork ambassador shakes his head.*
unity_station_embassy_bork.3=*Like the entire embassy, the Bork ambassador's office is big, but this time it's justified: most of it is taken up by an enormous holographic map of the inhabited Universe. Hey, you can make out the Solar system!* A breathtaking sight, isn't it? *The Bork ambassador is old and beaten up by life: he's missing two eyes and almost half of his teeth. His face is disfigured, if you can say that about a Bork mug, by an old burn.* I really wanted to meet you, human captain. *When he moves, you can tell right away that one of his legs is prosthetic.* Come in.
unity_station_embassy_bork.9.6=I think it's time to wrap up this conversation.
unity_station_embassy_bork.2=*You're going to have to knock, there's no secretary next to the office. However, that's not a problem: the lock clicks after the first knock. You can come in.*
unity_station_embassy_bork.9.5=The Gardener\u2026 yeah, it was\u2026 unforgettable.
unity_station_embassy_bork.1=*The paint on the walls is a pleasant orange hue, and the roof is transparent, like in the main hall. It's a beautiful, magestic sight. There is some kind of obelisk in the center of this room. If you walk up closer, you can read the plaque on it: \"Straight and unbending.\"*
unity_station_embassy_bork.9.4=The Obliterator?
unity_station_embassy_bork.0=*Inside, the Bork Embassy is... big. A big round hall with hallways leading from it to the offices. The architect seems to have gone overboard with gigantomania, there's too much empty space. You can see the ambassador's office door all the way from the entrance.*
unity_station_embassy_bork.9.3=Yeah, we're fighting the Zorsan. Anything wrong with that?
unity_station_embassy_bork.9.2=What's our colony to you?
unity_station_embassy_bork.9.1=What do you think the other ambassadors are going to want from me?
unity_station_embassy_bork.8.6=I think it's time to wrap up this conversation.
unity_station_embassy_bork.9.0=Why would the Zorsan ambassador have business with me?
unity_station_embassy_bork.8.5=The Gardener\u2026 yeah, it was\u2026 unforgettable.
unity_station_embassy_bork.8.4=The Obliterator?
unity_station_embassy_bork.8.3=Yeah, we're fighting the Zorsan. Anything wrong with that?
unity_station_embassy_bork.8.2=What's our colony to you?
unity_station_embassy_bork.8.1=And you don't want anything from me, then? How altruistic of you.
unity_station_embassy_bork.7.6=I think it's time to wrap up this conversation.
unity_station_embassy_bork.8.0=Why would the Zorsan ambassador have business with me?
unity_station_embassy_bork.7.5=The Gardener\u2026 yeah, it was\u2026 unforgettable.
unity_station_embassy_bork.7.4=The Obliterator?

unity_station_embassy_bork.6.7=I think it's time to wrap up this conversation.
unity_station_embassy_bork.7.1=And you don't want anything from me, then? How altruistic of you.
unity_station_embassy_bork.6.6=The Gardener\u2026 yeah, it was\u2026 unforgettable.
unity_station_embassy_bork.7.0=What do you think the other ambassadors are going to want from me?
unity_station_embassy_bork.6.5=The Obliterator?
unity_station_embassy_bork.6.4=Yeah, we're fighting the Zorsan. Anything wrong with that?
unity_station_embassy_bork.6.3=What's our colony to you?
unity_station_embassy_bork.6.2=And you don't want anything from me, then? How altruistic of you.
unity_station_embassy_bork.6.1=What do you think the other ambassadors are going to want from me?
unity_station_embassy_bork.6.0=Why would the Zorsan ambassador have business with me?
unity_station_embassy_bork.5.0=I was told that you wanted to talk to me.
unity_station_embassy_bork.4.1=I was told that you wanted to talk to me.
unity_station_embassy_bork.4.0=And what is the situation?
unity_station_embassy_bork.3.0=Hello. It really does look great.
unity_station_embassy_bork.2.0=*inside*
unity_station_embassy_bork.1.0=*to the ambassador*
unity_station_embassy_bork.0.1=*to the ambassador*
unity_station_embassy_bork.0.0=*take a better look around*
unity_station_embassy_bork.19.3=I'll think about it when I have a minute.
unity_station_embassy_bork.19.2=Very interetsting. But I'm more interested in something else: how could they have known? How could they make that recording?
unity_station_embassy_bork.19.1=The Zorsan?
unity_station_embassy_bork.19.0=And what about the humans?
unity_station_embassy_bork.18.0=In other words, the Rogue ambassador could help me while having his own secret goals. Hm.
unity_station_embassy_bork.16.7=I think it's time to wrap up this conversation.
unity_station_embassy_bork.17.0=That's reasonable.
unity_station_embassy_bork.16.6=The Gardener\u2026 yeah, it was\u2026 unforgettable.
unity_station_embassy_bork.16.5=The Obliterator?
unity_station_embassy_bork.16.4=Yeah, we're fighting the Zorsan. Anything wrong with that?
unity_station_embassy_bork.27.2=I'll think about it when I have a minute.
unity_station_embassy_bork.16.3=What's our colony to you?
unity_station_embassy_bork.27.1=The Zorsan?
unity_station_embassy_bork.16.2=And you don't want anything from me, then? How altruistic of you.
unity_station_embassy_bork.27.0=What about the humans?
unity_station_embassy_bork.16.1=What do you think the other ambassadors are going to want from me?
unity_station_embassy_bork.16.0=Why would the Zorsan ambassador have business with me?
unity_station_embassy_bork.27=Can't you establish contacts with anyone at any time you want? Does a job exist that you can't do, human captain? *Unusually, the ambassador stops to catch his breath instead of talking in his normal heavy style.* It's like... like you know where to press and how to get what you want, and some people are scared by it. If you can do it, does that mean that all humans can?
unity_station_embassy_bork.26=That's exactly what gives me and my colleagues some pause, human captain. The Gardeners seem to see this world... differently, as if they saw it from a different perspective, just like you humans.
unity_station_embassy_bork.15.3=Let's talk about something else.
unity_station_embassy_bork.25=No one knows. The Zorsan are good at hiding what they want hidden.
unity_station_embassy_bork.15.2=What if the stations disappear?
unity_station_embassy_bork.26.0=I don't understand what you mean.
unity_station_embassy_bork.24=That's the thing, we know about your first contact with the Gardeners... *The ambassador frowns and screws up his face in a way that's definitely unpleasant.* They talked with you... as with equals, they didn't try to conform to you. And those taqlks about the so-called philosophy of the Path, the Gardeners didn't talk to anybody else like that.
unity_station_embassy_bork.15.1=How strong is their influence?
unity_station_embassy_bork.23=See? We think alike. *The Bork nods.*
unity_station_embassy_bork.15.0=Does someone really want to capture our colony?
unity_station_embassy_bork.22=Suspicions and losses, suspicions and losses\u2026 *The Bork turns to face the window and looks out at outer space.*
unity_station_embassy_bork.21=I think you'll see for yourself when you get there, now that you have that planned. But keep in mind, it's not populated by humans, or if that sounds too drastic, not by humans like the ones you're used to.
unity_station_embassy_bork.25.2=I'll think about it when I have a minute.
unity_station_embassy_bork.20=Not capture. Influence it, human captain, since Earth is so unpredictable, so strong\u2026
unity_station_embassy_bork.25.1=Very interetsting. But I'm more interested in something else: how could they have known? How could they make that recording?
unity_station_embassy_bork.25.0=What about the humans?
unity_station_embassy_bork.14.0=In that case, see you later, Ambassador.
unity_station_embassy_bork.24.2=I'll think about it when I have a minute.
unity_station_embassy_bork.24.1=Very interetsting. But I'm more interested in something else: how could they have known? How could they make that recording?
unity_station_embassy_bork.23.7=I think it's time to wrap up this conversation.
unity_station_embassy_bork.24.0=The Zorsan?
unity_station_embassy_bork.23.6=The Gardener\u2026 yeah, it was\u2026 unforgettable.
unity_station_embassy_bork.23.5=The Obliterator?
unity_station_embassy_bork.13.0=Really?
unity_station_embassy_bork.23.4=Yeah, we're fighting the Zorsan. Anything wrong with that?
unity_station_embassy_bork.23.3=What's our colony to you?
unity_station_embassy_bork.23.2=And you don't want anything from me, then? How altruistic of you.
unity_station_embassy_bork.23.1=What do you think the other ambassadors are going to want from me?
unity_station_embassy_bork.23.0=Why would the Zorsan ambassador have business with me?
unity_station_embassy_bork.12.0=Is there really no way?
unity_station_embassy_bork.22.2=Let's talk about something else.
unity_station_embassy_bork.22.1=And how strong is that influence?
unity_station_embassy_bork.22.0=Does someone really want to capture our colony?
unity_station_embassy_bork.11.1=Hm\u2026 What if some creature asked another creature for help, offering instead\u2026 some other kind of help? Covert.
unity_station_embassy_bork.11.0=Thank you for the advice.
unity_station_embassy_bork.19=Definitely, the Gardeners find common ground with every people they contact too, did you know that? *The Bork starts counting on the fingers of the hand that has all of them.* With the Klisk, the Gardeners made a trade deal according to the Code. With the Rogues, they took part in one of their Masses to the Obliterator/Devourer...
unity_station_embassy_bork.18=There is always a way, human captain, or you wouldn't get called to talk by the Rogue ambassador. He probably wants to talk about the Obliterator problem. After all, for the Rogues it's a special subject, a lot of them believe unconditionally in that... *the translator module bugs out, like it sometimes does when it has to translate rare words.* ...Behemoth that keeps eating star systems. And the others are curious to find out what he is, but satisfying that curiosity yourself is very, very difficult.
unity_station_embassy_bork.21.2=Let's talk about something else.
unity_station_embassy_bork.17=Oh, *the Bork bares his teeth so much you can see which are missing, walks up to the table and leans on it with one of his arms,* I think the creature that was asked to help should be careful and trust no one.
unity_station_embassy_bork.21.1=What if the stations disappear?
unity_station_embassy_bork.16=*The Bork stands next to the giant window and moves the fingers of one of his paws thoughtfully.*
unity_station_embassy_bork.21.0=Does someone really want to capture our colony?
unity_station_embassy_bork.15=Trust an old Bork, what I'm about to tell is something everybody from the Veteran Council would get behind. *The Bork lets a pregnant silence fall.* It'd be better if the colony really did stay yours, and the trade stations stayed trade stations, because it benefits us. There is one of ours among them, too.
unity_station_embassy_bork.14=If that's what you think\u2026 *The Bork presses a button in his desk, opening the door.* I'm not saying goodbye, I'm saying see you later. Because I will.
unity_station_embassy_bork.10.0=Hm. So that's what you meant\u2026
unity_station_embassy_bork.13=Not just unforgettable. You are similar to him, human captain, to that Gardener. Not you as an individual, but you as a species.
unity_station_embassy_bork.12=Yeah, many people think that your people are done for, unless you find a way, of course. But no one thinks you will.
unity_station_embassy_bork.20.2=Let's talk about something else.
unity_station_embassy_bork.11=Nothing's wrong. You do understand that should you or the Zorsan break one rule of the convention... *The Bork drums his strong fingers on the window.* Many people want you to be the one break it, not the Zorsan. Keep that in mind.
unity_station_embassy_bork.20.1=What if the stations disappear?
unity_station_embassy_bork.10=Who told you it's yours, with all the trade stations in its orbit?.. considering how rare the flights from Earth to there are, I could disagree with your presumptuous statement already.
unity_station_embassy_bork.20.0=And how strong is that influence?
