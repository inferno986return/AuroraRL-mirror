gordon_science_theories_biology.2=*Oh, that was a bad move. In the next five minutes, Gordon gives you a million scientific terms and obscure neurobiological expressions, sometimes mixing it up with some favorite quote.* But Xi Fu says that at least it works! Since, you know, if it's green and it's moving, it's biology. If it stinks, it's chemistry. If it doesn't work, it's physics. Hahaha! *Gordon looks like a child when he laughs so happily.*
gordon_science_theories_biology.3.0=Of course. Over and out, Gordon.
gordon_science_theories_biology.1=Umm... Doctor Xi Fu says that it'll help us shift the paradigm of the neurobiological interpretation of the freedom of the brain... *Gordon smiles awkwardly.* I'm not a neurobiologist, but I can definitely say that it seems like we've come to understand the nature of the differences between explicit and implicit memory. That... that's great!
gordon_science_theories_biology.0=Captain, we've already studied the data you bought!
gordon_science_theories_biology.0.0=That was fast. Well?
gordon_science_theories_biology.2.0=I didn't understand a whole lot, but I'm glad the data was useful to you.
gordon_science_theories_biology.1.0=Why?
gordon_science_theories_biology.3=Very, C-C-Captain. I\u2026 I'll get going. My work can't wait.
