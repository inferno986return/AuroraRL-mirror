earth_dialog.56.0=As you've already said - we can't change anything.
earth_dialog.39=I see. Maybe that's why the connection isn't stable. Everything that was badly protected has been burnt. The rest is rattling and reeking.
earth_dialog.54.1=Yes, just a couple of things. 
earth_dialog.38=Thank you, but space will have to wait me for a little while. *Martan smiles* Anything else?
earth_dialog.54.0=No, nothing. I gotta go.
earth_dialog.37=Oh, and what? Are there any valuable things?
earth_dialog.36=That's a good decision. See, you are getting useful contacts. Brilliant. Commanders will be satisfied. Do you have something else to say?
earth_dialog.52.0=Prior, what's his name\u2030
earth_dialog.39.0=Oh, God damn it.
earth_dialog.37.0=You can go to our hatchway and look there. Or do I look like I have the list of all things?
earth_dialog.26=No spells no, why do you worry? The main thing is that everything is OK... kinda OK. Simply saying, you should have tried to do that quieter. If we had wanted to destroy blockade, we would have launched a couple of more powerful rockets. We're not so helpless.
earth_dialog.25=Good, but have you watched the TV? People are panicking, and different prophets are predicting the end of the days. It didn't worth it.
earth_dialog.24=Oh, I know. A greater part of the planet saw it.
earth_dialog.23=Nothing. Any other questions?
earth_dialog.22=You should know better, but... *Martan noddles*
earth_dialog.21=*Martan narrows his eyes* I won't say I approve such a method of solving problems. I suppose that the rest of the pirates won't flock in for the sake of profit.
earth_dialog.89.1=I still have a few questions.
earth_dialog.20=Really? Good. You've made that. Commanders will be satisfied. You can go if it's all you wanted to tell me.
earth_dialog.89.0=No. I have to go now.
earth_dialog.87.1=Oh, no. Just change the terminal and do anything you want with the old one. I have more than two hundred people on board, I don't need troubles.
earth_dialog.87.0=You know, you're right. Let this creature stay on the spaceship. No one knows what might happen next.
earth_dialog.85.0=I suppose. So, what? Will you change it?
earth_dialog.12.0=A beacon was burnt by flying in the star. There is certainly no evidence. But what was that? Did I hear a sarcasm? Ah... fine. Whatever. I hope you will leave this girly things behind, when I arrive here next time.
earth_dialog.10.0=You told me about the object near the star, do you remember that? It turned out to be a space cemetery of rogues. Nothing unusual, yet it functioned using the energy of that star.
earth_dialog.81.1=To be brief. It is a blue semitransparent sphere. Made of something that looks like fog, but that's not fog.
earth_dialog.13=Me too. Anything else?
earth_dialog.81.0=So, here it is. Take the terminal and give me a new one.
earth_dialog.12=I see. *Martan is frowning* I totally understand you. There goes the worst: I understand you and do encourage your decisions. I think people won't share my attitude. Congratulations, Mr. Whole Planet's Hero. I hope you didn't leave an evidence?
earth_dialog.68.0=Okay. Then I have to go. Time is precious. 
earth_dialog.11=So, you looted the cemetery, didn't you? So if the needed equipment is carried out of there, then it is destroyed, am I right?
earth_dialog.10=Seriously? Where have you found this?
earth_dialog.66.0=I'm listening to you.
earth_dialog.64.1=W-w-wait, what's the Voyager?
earth_dialog.64.0=I'm all ears.
earth_dialog.62.0=Yes. We can expect their attack less than in a couple of years. The most technologically developed race in deep space... Things look so bad.
earth_dialog.60.0=Oh, sure. Right. I'll figured that out.
earth_dialog.9.1=No, nothing serious.
earth_dialog.9.0=Just a couple of things.
earth_dialog.41.1=Yes, just a couple of things.
earth_dialog.41.0=No, nothing. I gotta go.
earth_dialog.7.0=Confirmed, again. Send the main information to the science division of the Aurora-2. I have to go now.
earth_dialog.26.1=You are always being unsatisfied. You know, I feel, you are too one-sided and narrow-minded. Anyway, fine. It's done, we can change nothing. I have to fly away.
earth_dialog.26.0=Nothing you can do now. You are always being unsatisfied. Fine. I have some questions for you.
earth_dialog.97.1=A few questions more.
earth_dialog.97.0=No, no questions.
earth_dialog.24.0=I had nothing else to do.
earth_dialog.95.1=Not sure, but it doesn't mean anything.
earth_dialog.95.0=Yes.
earth_dialog.22.0=But?
earth_dialog.93.0=Yes, it would be horrible.
earth_dialog.20.1=I have some things to arrange.
earth_dialog.20.0=No, nothing. I gotta go. Have a lot to do.
earth_dialog.91.1=Nothig unusual, but one thing... There are rather aggressive creatures.
earth_dialog.91.0=Just a simple planet. A little bit unusual, but it's normal, nothing special.
earth_dialog.78.1=That's not important. They agreed to cooperate, but, unfortunately, didn't manage to help in war.
earth_dialog.78.0=Silly or not - that's not my trouble. The main thing is they agreed to cooperate with us and gave us some kind of help. Great stuff: schemes of spaceships and rare details. Don't know yet how to use it.
earth_dialog.9=Yes. You hit the right road, when you didn't do it. Well done, my friend. Anything else?
earth_dialog.8=Oh. In such case I'm ready to listen.
earth_dialog.7=There's an unknown object that is close to one of them, it has a stronger radiation. It's too hard to see it from here - it's tiny. It'd be great, if you check that as well.
earth_dialog.6=Well, there's almost nothing to say. There are three neutron stars that have extremely unusual rays. The only thing you need is to explore its influence over the systems of their navigation. Make an observation in the space, explore any planet... No need in doing your best, just the needful minimum, and then you may return.
earth_dialog.76.2=That's all.
earth_dialog.76.1=As for the borks.
earth_dialog.4=Yeah, you're right. Scientists want you to help them in some things.
earth_dialog.76.0=As for the rogues. 
earth_dialog.0=Well, you're back. Any good news?
earth_dialog.74.3=I'm so sorry, but we failed to come to an agreement.
earth_dialog.74.2=We had a conversation, yet we didn't come to an agreement.
earth_dialog.74.1= We discussed with them terms of the cooperation. I wasted a lot of time, trying to do it. 
earth_dialog.74.0=They are okay. Their representative will be here... I don't know when, that's a complicated question. As for the help, they gave us three battleship's gun platforms. We researched them a bit while we were transfering them here. They are very powerful. Though, they are considered to be old-fashioned. Unfortunately, they won't fit the Aurora-2 - they are too large for it, also the spaceship doesn't have enough energy for them.
earth_dialog.59.1=I had found the information before I got back.
earth_dialog.72.0=Don't know yet. This question is brought up for discussion for Elders Board. I need to pay them a visit again.
earth_dialog.59.0=Don't really know. After I had escaped I flew here. It wasn't simple.
earth_dialog.70.2=I'll be brief - we've failed.
earth_dialog.70.1=Well... that depends. We talked with them about a cooperation, they even promised to help us in defending, but I'm in doubt they can really do something worthwile. Nevertheless,  every little bit helps.
earth_dialog.57.1=Yup, just a few questions.
earth_dialog.70.0=Everything is okay. They promised to send us a representative, and, in addition, they'll help in holding off an attack. 
earth_dialog.57.0=No, nothing. I gotta go.
earth_dialog.55.0=You shouldn't have mentioned the last one. Is it so important?
earth_dialog.53.0=Yes, him. That was close to his performances, but softer a bit.
earth_dialog.97=*Martan narrows his eyes, looks at himself* Not really, then okay... If something goes wrong, you are responsible for everything. Do you have any other questions?
earth_dialog.96=Well, okay then. Come back in a few months, you'll take the colonists. Any other questions?
earth_dialog.95=Hm, it seems to be too calm. Have you investigated it properly?
earth_dialog.94=I'll look into it... Come back in a few months, you'll take the colonists. Anything else?
earth_dialog.51.1=Yes, I still have some questions.
earth_dialog.93=*Martan shakes his head and picks up the phone. Frowns unwittingly* We need to take a control of the preparation... everything can happen. I don't want our guys to be torn apart.
earth_dialog.38.1=No, nothing. I have to go now.
earth_dialog.51.0=No, nothing else. See ya.
earth_dialog.92=What do you mean?
earth_dialog.38.0=Yes, just a couple of things.
earth_dialog.91=So, then we just have to bring colonists to the planet. You'll do it, but a little bit later, when everything is prepared. It makes me wonder, how does it look like? Tell me, please. I don't want to search the information.
earth_dialog.90=Hm? Excellent... *Martan gets distracted, puts some information into the computer* I hope, your people have already sent them to the science division, haven't they?
earth_dialog.36.1=No, nothing. I gotta go now.
earth_dialog.36.0=Yes, just a couple of things.
earth_dialog.89=Right. Good choice. Anything else?
earth_dialog.88=That's a good decision.
earth_dialog.87=What happens if you meet his congeners? Your new acquaintance might help you. Though, I don't know how exactly... but, anyway. What's the profit of this sphere on Earth? *Martan becomes silent, after a while he takes a pen* It's up to you.
earth_dialog.86=I told you I could. It's a simple task. But here's the situation. You have a creature on your spaceship. It is harmless, smart and it powers devices. Here comes an academic interest. 
earth_dialog.85=Is that all?
earth_dialog.84=\"*\"\"you're probably overworked, but that's interesting\"\"*\"
earth_dialog.88.1=I still have a few questions.
earth_dialog.82=\"*giving a glance: \"\"Probably overworked\"\"*\"
earth_dialog.88.0=No. I gotta go.
earth_dialog.81=*Martan is silent, he expects you to continue*
earth_dialog.80=Then use the force!
earth_dialog.86.0=So, take it to Earth.
earth_dialog.13.1=No, nothing serious.
earth_dialog.13.0=Just a couple of things.
earth_dialog.84.1=Klisks helped me to contact that sphere. We had a conversation, nothing unusual. He refuses to go away, and we can't hurt him, he can't hurt us. That's the good news.
earth_dialog.84.0=And that's the end! Just change the terminal, nothing more. I don't need troubles on the spaceship.
earth_dialog.11.0=Unfortunately. So it goes. The result is worth the effort.
earth_dialog.69.3=Enough, the rest I'll read in a written report.
earth_dialog.82.1=This sphere is compatible with our main scientific terminal. For such creatures it's kinda way of life. We tried to switch the terminal off, but it continued working. Maybe that sphere can power it somehow. The only thing we can do now is to throw it away in space.
earth_dialog.69.2=As for the rogues.
earth_dialog.82.0=So, here it is. Take the terminal and give me a new one.
earth_dialog.69.1=As for the klisks. 
earth_dialog.69.0=As for the borks.
earth_dialog.79=What? That's strange. They promised to give us some kind of an unseen confidence... *Martan winces and hands a sheet of paper* You know, I'm not surprised. Tell me more about your problem. We have at least five of them for you. We'll replace them all at once.
earth_dialog.78=Rogues? Why do they call themselves in such a silly way?..
earth_dialog.77=\"Gun platforms? *Martan gave me a cunning smile* I call it \"\"the irony of our creation\"\"... Don't mind. Continue. \"
earth_dialog.76=Fine, anything else?
earth_dialog.75=So bad. Okay, we didn't lose everything. Continue.
earth_dialog.80.0=That doesn't work out, too. You know, this creature doesn't detect us. It doesn't see us, we're too different.
earth_dialog.74=Giant snails. Yuck! What's wrong with them?
earth_dialog.67.0=I see. Don't know their reaction yet, but I'll do my best. What about my full powers?
earth_dialog.72=Good. What's the help?
earth_dialog.71=I'll be brief, too. Jesus Christ! Will you continue?
earth_dialog.70=Borks... they are big and dumb, aren't they? Am I right? Never mind, do it.
earth_dialog.65.0=What good will an another Aurora do, when they bring all of there their forces?
earth_dialog.0.17=We've found an excellent planet for a future colonization.
earth_dialog.0.16=I have nothing to make you happy. I have a trouble with the main scientific terminal.
earth_dialog.0.15=I've finished the diplomatic mission.
earth_dialog.0.14=I've got an important information about zorsans.
earth_dialog.0.13=Martan, urgently. It's very important and about zorsans.
earth_dialog.0.12=I've set things right with aliens on the Moon. I destroyed their aggregate.
earth_dialog.0.11=As for the aliens on the Moon, I helped them to fix their chanpel. Then I was kind of an honorable viewer. Then they flew away, so we won't have troubles with them anymore.
earth_dialog.63.0=What to speed up?
earth_dialog.0.10=As for the aliens on the Moon. I had a conversation with their elder, he recalled them in the end.
earth_dialog.61.0=I suppose, yes. Check out the documents at your computer. I sent them, when we were landing.
earth_dialog.69=Next.
earth_dialog.68=Now just persuade them into sending their representatives here for a temporary accomodation. Then it'll be our turn. See, that's not hard. 
earth_dialog.67=Basically, it's the same. Need to make contracts of diplomatic relationship with all those... *Martan waves his hands* borks, klisks? You know what I mean. We need their help. 
earth_dialog.66=It isn't the Aurora. It's the Voyager. Again, you'll have a different task.
earth_dialog.65=Just another spaceship. I can't tell you more. 
earth_dialog.64=Voyager. To speed the Voyager up. Never mind... You'll have a different task.
earth_dialog.63=*Martan wipes off the sweat from his forehead* Damn... We need to... to send it to analysts right now! And to commanders! That's a change of plans... Argh!Need to speed it up.
earth_dialog.62=*Martan is looking through data for a few minutes. When he lifts his head up, you can see his fearful glance* You... You... Do you know what that means?!!
earth_dialog.61=And what? I'm all ears. Is it serious?
earth_dialog.60=That's bad. You need to know what we need to be afraid of in the case of an attack. We can't make mistakes. *Martan is looking at you without a word. You're looking at him. It's about seven seconds of silence when Martan finally says* That is an order.
earth_dialog.8.1=All the information is sent to the scientists, but it's not important already. The most important thing is an amazing technology that gives an opportunity to recycle solar emission into a chip electrical energy.
earth_dialog.8.0=Nothing special. The information about the radiation is sent to the science division. As well as about the object. It's a space cemetery of rogues. I guess, honored rogues are buried there. It's a sacred place, well-protected, we didn't even try to get into it.
earth_dialog.6.0=On it. Anything else?
earth_dialog.59=*Martan frowns and puts his elbows on a table. Then leans forward a bit* What? Well. Is it serious?
earth_dialog.58=Zorsans? Who are they? What is happening?
earth_dialog.25.0=And I'm telling you one more time: I had no choice.
earth_dialog.57=Yes. Commanders are on the rampage... Okay. It's gonna be alright. It always calms down and then everything gets alright. Do you want something?
earth_dialog.56=Maine has suffered a lot, don't worry. We can't change what we've done, but... Damn it! Could you please be a little bit more careful?
earth_dialog.96.1=There are a few questions left.
earth_dialog.55=Thank you. Now I know whom to thank. Have you read the news? Miami has flooded. Palms from Cuba had been torn off, then they were thrown down in Carolina. The scary-house named after Stephen King has been destroyed in Maine.
earth_dialog.96.0=No, no questions.
earth_dialog.54=Heh, interesting. Okay. I'll tell the commanders about your success. Any other questions?
earth_dialog.53=David Koresh.
earth_dialog.4.0=I'm all ears.
earth_dialog.52=So, did you enjoy the show? Really interesting.
earth_dialog.23.1=I have some things to arrange.
earth_dialog.51=Alright then. I see you are getting acquainted with new people. Not bad. *Martan harrumphs* Any other questions?
earth_dialog.23.0=No, nothing. I gotta go. Have a lot to do.
earth_dialog.94.1=A few questions more.
earth_dialog.94.0=Nothing.
earth_dialog.0.9=There's no bot on orbit already. I had to... Ehm... In a few words, we set the fur flying.
earth_dialog.0.8=The problem with the bot is solved. I had to go trought some expenses. I bought all of the test versions and then I went for a bot to the central storage... It won't come back here.
earth_dialog.0.7=The problem with the bot is solved. I came to agreement with klisks' big boss. Nothing to it.
earth_dialog.0.6=I have solved the problem with borks. However, probably, you already know it.
earth_dialog.0.5=The problem with borks is solved. I've got, what they needed. It wasn't a fair square, but there things you need to do for saving your home planet.
earth_dialog.21.0=We had no choice, Martan.
earth_dialog.0.4=The problem with borks is solved. I had a conversation with a smart bork. By the way, he's their resident minister. He set things right.
earth_dialog.0.3=I'm ready to report that the scientists' mission is accomplished.
earth_dialog.92.0=Literally, aggressive and strong. It will be hard for colonists if they aren't well-armed.
earth_dialog.0.2=I heard you have a job for me. Something concerning the science division's order. 
earth_dialog.79.0=The terminal is not the point, but I have one creature more on my spaceship because of it. And I can't chase it away.
earth_dialog.0.1=Nothing, just joined the party to have a rest and do some repair works.
earth_dialog.0.0=We've brought some presents from deep space. We're transmitting the received data.
earth_dialog.77.2=That's it.
earth_dialog.90.0=Sure, everything is okay.
earth_dialog.77.1=As for the borks.
earth_dialog.77.0=As for the rogues.
earth_dialog.75.2=That's it. 
earth_dialog.75.1=As for the borks.
earth_dialog.75.0=As for the rogues. 
earth_dialog.41=Nah. *Martan waved his hand* That's good we don't have this trash on orbit anymore. I simply didn't expect this... Well. Do you have something else?
earth_dialog.71.2=That's all. 
earth_dialog.71.1=As for the rogues.
earth_dialog.71.0=As for the klisks.
earth_dialog.58.0=They are alien race... one of them. Doesn't matter. They tried to trap me during the diplomatic reception.
