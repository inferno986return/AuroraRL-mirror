rogues_altar_2.1.0=Okay. Explain, then, please, why did your manipulations change the way the Moon affects our planet? Our coastal cities are in danger.
rogues_altar_2.9=Okay. Your ship. Give us clear comms. We'll send you a list of what we need.
rogues_altar_2.8=Yes. Do you want to help us?
rogues_altar_2.7=Our own. Praying to the Essence of the Devourer is happiness. But we were sent here by Elder Hoor, from Mothership Brau. Is that what you meant?
rogues_altar_2.3.0=Look, I don't think you understood me. I'll repeat. Your actions put our cities in danger. That is bad. And it will go on until you fix your broken Altar..
rogues_altar_2.6=A fight? You will become the Essence of the Devourer. *The Rogue is angry.*
rogues_altar_2.5=*His answer is silence and a steadfast stare.*
rogues_altar_2.4=We're sorry. We really are. But we can't.
rogues_altar_2.5.3=Okay, I need to call an urgent officer's meeting. I have to go.
rogues_altar_2.3=That means that we can't leave Luna. It's a beautiful name. Until the prayer is done, we can't go back. Until the Altar is working, the prayer can't be done.
rogues_altar_2.5.2=Right. The Altar is broken. So if it gets fixed, the cataclysms on our planets will stop and you will be able to leave?
rogues_altar_2.2=We know. Our Altar is broken.
rogues_altar_2.5.1=That's not going to work. Whose orders did you start all this on, anyway?
rogues_altar_2.1=We're praying to the Essence of the Devourer and to the Essence of your star. And this is our Altar. The prayer is useless without it.
rogues_altar_2.5.0=I'm sorry it's come to this, but if you won't go for a peaceful solution, we'll have to use force.
rogues_altar_2.0=\"*A strangely dressed alien is looking at you
rogues_altar_2.7.0=Elder Hoor, Mothership Brau\u2026 Good. If you guys are so dense, I'll have to go pay him a visit.
rogues_altar_2.9.0=Deal. I'm going back there. Don't take too long.
rogues_altar_2.0.0=I greet you, too. Tell me, what is this structure? And what are you doing on my planet's moon?
rogues_altar_2.2.0=Does that mean that you'll leave Luna and take your equipment with you?
rogues_altar_2.4.0=Last chance. Do you refuse?
rogues_altar_2.6.0=And you will become research material.
rogues_altar_2.8.1=I don't think so. This solution is too unpleasant for me.
rogues_altar_2.8.0=What choice do I have?
