sarah_past_1.5.2=How exactly did you end up on the Aurora?
sarah_past_1.5.1=Are there a lot of you talented folk there?
sarah_past_1.5.0=Aren't you a bit too cocky?
sarah_past_1.7.3=I see. That's some self-esteem you have there, Frontz. Maybe it's not warranted, but I don't have time to talk now. Over and out.

sarah_past_1.7.1=Are there a lot of you talented folk there?
sarah_past_1.7.0=Aren't you a bit too cocky?
sarah_past_1.0.0=Why do you think it's you?
sarah_past_1.2.0=Uhhh\u2026 I haven't.
sarah_past_1.4.0=What's wrong with your father?
sarah_past_1.7=Remember, your words, not mine. *She smiles and looks at you, squinting.* 
sarah_past_1.6=Just like the rest of us. I filled out an application, dropped it into the little box, and then I got picked. It's weird, the time we live in, and those dumbasses still use paper applications... Going through a million of those pieces of paper, that's terrifying, right? And they picked me.
sarah_past_1.5=No, nothing is wrong with him. He's just really, really strict. An Orthodox Jew.
sarah_past_1.6.0=The best of the best?
sarah_past_1.4=By \"there\" you mean in the kibbutzim? My brother is a sniper, he's good. He's still in the army, I think he's even made major... and apart from that... that's it. My dad writes to me. He's never talked about someone from Flava making it big. I'm their local celebrity. *Sarah smirks, but now her smile is sad.* 
sarah_past_1.3=And I have! *Sarah says that with pride.* In some ways, it's more valuable than reading a thousand books.
sarah_past_1.2=*Sarah smiles and shakes her head no.* Nope. What, would you prefer some hunder-years-old geezer who hasn't seen a working engine in about five hundred years working in my place? Nope, Cap, that's not how it works. For an engineer, especially a good one, the most important thing is experience. I can fix absolutely anything. Even a tank with my bare hands. And then I'll build a new tank from whatever's left over. Have you ever changed tracks on a tank in forty-degree heat?
sarah_past_1.1=Haven't we talked about this? *Sarah frowns, trying to remember.* I don't remember. Anyway! Why me? It's simple, I'm a really good engineer. Maybe even a genius, Cap. Isn't it great that you have a genius working on your ship?
sarah_past_1.0=Really? Well, that's how it is, then! I don't know what the big fuss is, though.
sarah_past_1.1.3=I see. That's some self-esteem you have there, Frontz. Maybe it's not warranted, but I don't have time to talk now. Over and out.
