colony_planet_not_enough_space.0=*Gordon looks disappointed.* C-Captain, I'm afraid this planet isn't suitable for us. It has breathable atmosphere and a-acceptable gravitation, but the terrain! There's no place to build settlements! 
colony_planet_not_enough_space.0.0=Yeah, there aren't many places suitable for building on the surface. We'll have to look for a different planet.
