gordon_science_theories_math.1.0=And now?
gordon_science_theories_math.3=Uhhh... *Gordon is confused.* Well... You s-s-see, a path integral is the result of integrating by trajectories, the calculation of arbitrary composite functions by arbitrary function spaces or some subset... *A couple of minutes of puzzling explanations and terms later...* ...and if Gauss calculations were already pretty beneficial before, now... wow!
gordon_science_theories_math.2=And now we're on the brink of calculating path integrals for general cases!
gordon_science_theories_math.3.0=Okay. Keep working. I hope this data really is\u2026 useful. Although I didn't really understand anything.
gordon_science_theories_math.1=Path integrals, Captain! Path integrals! Before, we could only calculate them for cases of Gauss squaring!
gordon_science_theories_math.0=Captain, we've already studied the data!
gordon_science_theories_math.0.0=That was quick. Is there anything interesting?
gordon_science_theories_math.2.0=And what does that mean?
