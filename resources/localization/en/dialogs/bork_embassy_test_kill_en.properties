bork_embassy_test_kill.11.0=I come with a diplomatic mission, actually. Humans are a young people who only discovered space relatively recently. We think we should make friends with the species that populate it.
bork_embassy_test_kill.3.1=I come with a diplomatic mission, actually. Humans are a young people who only discovered space relatively recently. We think we should make friends with the species that populate it.
bork_embassy_test_kill.3.0=No, wait. That Bork was acting very strange. He was obviously trying to provoke me. There was a reason why he attacked me.
bork_embassy_test_kill.10.0=I had to.
bork_embassy_test_kill.18.1=Well, then\u2026 Sorry for taking up your time. I have to go. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.18.0=There is something. A Bork fleet led by someone named Hrrraka has blockaded my planet. That Hrrraka told me to talk to some, and I quote, \"smart Bork.\" 
bork_embassy_test_kill.2.0=He attacked us first.
bork_embassy_test_kill.17.0=But wait, what if the Zorsan decide to attack you after the war with the humans? 
bork_embassy_test_kill.1.0=Is something bothering you?
bork_embassy_test_kill.9.2=Doesn't matter. The point is, I'm not guilty. I didn't start the fight, I only defended myself! 
bork_embassy_test_kill.9.1=Apology from the Zorsan Emperor?
bork_embassy_test_kill.9.0=Klisk Code?
bork_embassy_test_kill.16.1=There is something else. Urgent business. The Zorsan are getting together a fleet to attack my planet. I don't have to tell what the Zorsan are like. Any help is welcome.
bork_embassy_test_kill.16.0=Well, this is sad. Too bad. The only thing I can do now is say goodbye. I hope the next time we see each other will be more pleasant. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.0.0=Hello.
bork_embassy_test_kill.8.2=Doesn't matter. The point is, I'm not guilty. I didn't start the fight, I only defended myself! 
bork_embassy_test_kill.8.1=Klisk Code?
bork_embassy_test_kill.8.0=Apology from the Zorsan Emperor?
bork_embassy_test_kill.9=We were at war with them some time ago. And generally speaking, the Zorsan aren't the most pleasant people around. Consider it free advice. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.15.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test_kill.8=What, you don't know anything about the Obliterator? Well, all in due time, Human captain. You'll find out. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.7=The Klisk Code of Commerce. They do all their trade operations according to it. Sometimes they even have losses because of it. It's highly illogical. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.6=Well, congratulate yourself on being so far-sighted, but I don't think it will change what has happened. If you possessed the secret of the Klisk code, the remote for the Obliterator, or even brought us an official apology from the Zorsan Emperor, it wouldn't have changed anything. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.5=In that case, let's get to business already. I don't really want it to take longer than it has to.
bork_embassy_test_kill.4=What, you know my people well enough to say what is typical for them and what isn't? *Kartar bares his teeth. When a creature whose mouth can fit a medium-sized watermelon bares its teeth, it's scary.* 
bork_embassy_test_kill.3=And that is the only reason you were allowed in here. Let's get to business. My name is Kartar. I am the diplomatic representative of my country.
bork_embassy_test_kill.7.2=Doesn't matter. The point is, I'm not guilty. I didn't start the fight, I only defended myself! 
bork_embassy_test_kill.2=Is something bothering me? *He leans on his elbows.* Mister, you just shot a citizen of my country in the face. In my waiting room. I don't know the customs of your lands, but on ours it's kind of frowned upon. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.7.1=Apology from the Zorsan Emperor?
bork_embassy_test_kill.1=*He is a Bork. Weird, right? You can see the difference between him and a regular Bork right away. Firstly, it's how he dresses. The diplomatic representative is wearing some sort of a two-piece suit, and that makes him look even wider than he would have looked without it. Secondly, it's his eyes. A regular Bork's eyes are very cloudy, whereas you recognize a sharp intellect in the eyes of the representative.* Yeah... Hello to you, too. I won't say I'm glad to see you, but you do deserve a greeting.
bork_embassy_test_kill.7.0=Obliterator?
bork_embassy_test_kill.0=*The Bork Diplomatic Representative's office is very lavish and a bit scary. You get this impression because of the numerous carved elements that are literally everywhere, from top to bottom. The owner himself, apparently, feels right at home in this ambiance, and he looks pretty lively.*
bork_embassy_test_kill.14.2=Yes, urgent business. The Zorsan are getting together a fleet to attack my planet. I don't have to tell what the Zorsan are like. Any help is welcome.
bork_embassy_test_kill.14.1=There is something. A Bork fleet led by someone named Hrrraka has blockaded my planet. That Hrrraka told me to talk to some, and I quote, \"smart Bork.\" 
bork_embassy_test_kill.14.0=No, no more business. I'm sorry it turned out like this, but I hope that some day we will be able to really work together. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.6.3=It won't change anything, but I'm not guilty. I had to defend myself. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.6.2=Apology from the Zorsan Emperor?
bork_embassy_test_kill.6.1=Obliterator?
bork_embassy_test_kill.6.0=Klisk Code?
bork_embassy_test_kill.13.0=Is this because of what happened in the waiting room?
bork_embassy_test_kill.18=They won't. Are we done? *The Bork's eyes look tired rather than intelligent now. He is bored.*
bork_embassy_test_kill.17=I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to deny your request. The Borks have just gotten out of a conflict with the Zorsan. The war hit us pretty hard, we don't need another one. If the Zorsan find out about us helping you - and it's impossible to hide something like that - another conflict is inevitable. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.16=Hrrraka? *Kartar lets out a strange roar.* Never heard of him. I have no idea about how I could help you. Apparently, your planet is blockaded by pirates. I'm very sorry, but... *Kartar bares his teeth meaningfully.* 
bork_embassy_test_kill.15=Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
bork_embassy_test_kill.14=I don't know myself. I'm just the voice of my government. Well, that's pretty much it. If you have any more business, I suggest you get to it now.
bork_embassy_test_kill.13=*The Bork pauses for a bit, then continues.* Well, then. We welcome peace. We will be happy to accept human space ships and won't get in the way of signing any trade treaties. That will benefit everyone. As to any cooperation on the intergovernmental level... I'm sorry, but I've been authorized to deny your proposal. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.5.0=I come with a diplomatic mission, actually. Humans are a young people who only discovered space relatively recently. We think we should make friends with the species that populate it.
bork_embassy_test_kill.12=Yes, I understand. I got the information packet you sent from your ship. The analytics department gave me their verdict just a couple of minutes before you shot that poor soul in the face. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.11=I understand. But alas. Let's get to business. I don't want to drag this conversation out any more than what is necessary. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.10=You are only here because you didn't start it. And about your not being guilty\u2026 Look, you were the one who pulled the trigger. 
bork_embassy_test_kill.12.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test_kill.4.1=Actually, I dedicated some time to doing my homework before coming here. I bought some information from the Klisks. So yes, I can say that the way that Bork was acting was not typical at all.
bork_embassy_test_kill.4.0=Unfortunately, I don't.
