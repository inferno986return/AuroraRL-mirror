sarah_pray.9.0=It's not your fault.
sarah_pray.0.0=*accept the call*
sarah_pray.2.1=Sarah? I don't want to interrupt but you've got something with your communication system.
sarah_pray.2.0=*don't interrupt*
sarah_pray.4.1=Sarah! Umm\u2026 damn it\u2026. your camera's on!
sarah_pray.4.0=*wait*
sarah_pray.6.0=*more*
sarah_pray.9=*Sarah squints and quickly checks something. She looks at the lens attentively. Her lips for the light smile so typical of her.* You're right. There's some bug... I need to run some diagnostics... Cap, I'm sorry for what happened.
sarah_pray.8.0=Calm down! I told you, something wrong with the camera! Or the comms! Your call just happened by itself!
sarah_pray.8=Oh?! What?! Cap, what the\u2026
sarah_pray.7=*The song ends, and so does Sarah's dance. She takes a towel from the cupboard. Now, when she's not moving, there's something you can take note of. Her scars. There are a lot. On her back, her arms, her legs. There are old ones and there ones made a long time ago, but not as long as to make them almost heal. Those aren't bullet wounds, they aren't knife stabs. You can't understand where they came from, those things looking like a bad painter's brush strokes... Sarah comes out of the camera's view. You can hear the door close.*
sarah_pray.6=*Her body is definitely a lot like a boy's. Skinny, almost bony, but with tight muscles showing through her skin. What is setting Sarah apart from a completely androgynous build are her typically feminine curves. Small but firm breasts, tight buttocks. Sarah smiles and throws her head up, still dancing. Her black hair falls back, opening her laughing face fully. She threw her hands to the sides and she's turning around herself, shuffling her feet lightly.*
sarah_pray.5=*The overalls. Then standard issue military underwear. She still hasn't turned off the music, and she keeps taking her clothes off to its light rhythm, tossing her things around the room.*
sarah_pray.1.1=Umm\u2026 Sarah. You've got something wrong with your camera.
sarah_pray.4=*Sarah turns on some music. Something old, electronica. She is dancing, shaking her hips lightly. She's smiling. She can't dance but it looks cute. In about thirty seconds she remembers something and runs outside of the camera's view. The sound of a door opening, then of running water from a tap. Sarah runs back into the camera's view and starts... undressing?!*
sarah_pray.1.0=*don't interrupt*
sarah_pray.3=*This goes on for a rather long time, about half an hour if not more. Still, it's interesting to watch. Sarah has a melodic, husky (but feminine) voice, and she can't complain about her lack of reciting skill. It all ends with the phrase:* veareva lA-donay minhat Yeuda vIrushalaim kimey olam uhshanim kadmoniyot. *Sarah picks up the photograph and looks at it for a long time, her gaze hidden from the camera. She's whispering something. You can't make out the words, just the overall tone: it's angry and irritated. In the end, she sets the photograph down to face the wall.*
sarah_pray.2=El agadol agibor veanora, El elyon, gomel hasadim tovim, vekone akol vezoher hasdey avot, umevi goel livney livney veneem lemaan shemo beaava. *Sarah breathes in deeply, shaking a little back and forth, after which she starts to read again.*
sarah_pray.1=*It's obviously some system bug, and the call happened randomly. The camera is on, it's showing Sarah's room. She's standing up straight, stretching up unnaturally, and praying. You can't see her face, she's standing with her back to the camera. You can only see what she's looking at. It's a picture of some bearded old man wearing a black hat.*
sarah_pray.0=*A call from Sarah. Weird. She doesn't report, but there is a calling signal.*
sarah_pray.3.1=Sarah? Something's wrong with your comms. The call just happened by itself. I didn't want to interrupt your prayer.
sarah_pray.3.0=*keep quiet*
sarah_pray.5.0=*too late to let your presence be known now*
sarah_pray.10=Uh-hu. *she nods* But still. *She's in a hurry, and she's a little embarrassed.* Over and out. *she signs off*
sarah_pray.7.0=Weird scars\u2026 did someone hit her? If they did, how could they do it with such force?... Weird\u2026
sarah_pray.10.0=I'll be. That sure was a short conversation. And still\u2026 nevermind.
