earth_first_return_2.8=*The next one. A microphone behind your face again.* Oh, conflicts! Did conflicts take place?!
earth_first_return_2.7=*satisfied with such a detailed answer journalist steps aside. In the meantime, the second Kilmovi makes an approving sign, you face the camera.* Live! Good afternoon, my dear friends, today we're taking part in a press-conference dedicated to the return of the Aurora-2 spaceship from the expedition! And we have no time to lose. So, commander, crisis is still eating away the planet. Have you  found a way to solve this problem? 
earth_first_return_2.12=*Kilmovi smiles unkindly* You wish.
earth_first_return_2.6=*journalist is a little bit embarrassed* Ehma Aliens. What did the communication with aliens come to? Should we expect some kind of a long-term cooperation? 
earth_first_return_2.5=\"*the audience calms down again. Kilmovi is choosing a journalist thoroughly, and the next question you receive from a stout man with a less presentable appearance* George Zotov. \"\"World's Voice\"\" publishing. What's the result of your contacts with aliens?\"
earth_first_return_2.11=*buzz and hubbub. It's hard to understand people's attitude to you, but there's no need in it. Kilmovi checks his watch, bids farewell and you go away with him through a side door. 
earth_first_return_2.4=*audience rushes to the tribune. The young journalist is swept to the back seats.  Kilmovi starts to frown.* Gentlemen! Stop it! Enough! I will have to end the conference earlier!
earth_first_return_2.10=*Kilmovi raises his hands but the cameras are already pointed at you and everybody wants the answer* The Aurora! The lost spaceship! What can you say about it?! 
earth_first_return_2.3=*the girl gesticulates with passion. Her breasts is slightly shaking.* The second! The second question!! According to the information we have received from the Aurora they've met the aliens!! And what about you, did you meet them?! If the answer is positive, how far have you got in the development of an interplanetary relationship?! 
earth_first_return_2.2=\"*It's a girl. She's about twenty or even less. C sized breasts and a form-fitting jacket.* Blogging platform \"\"Empire\"\"! Tell us, please, how did space welcome you?! Did you have a contact with aliens?\"
earth_first_return_2.1=*A few minites later the crawd finally calms down. But still there are a lot of speedlights and clicks. Kilimovi takes the floor once again* Dear journalists, I need to notice the fact that we don't have much time. I will be much appreciated if you try to understand it. *here comes the encouragment noise. After a while of looking around a sea of hands he points out a hand*
earth_first_return_2.7.2=Lady, you probably overestimate the Aurora-2. We're simple people. However, we do have several ideas.
earth_first_return_2.0=*You're behind a tribune, Kilmovi is next to you. There's a small room full of people. Sounds of recording cameras and speedlights. There's an awful buzz. Finally tired Kilimovi waves his hands and knocks on the tribune.* Gentlemen, silence, please! 
earth_first_return_2.7.1=Certainly, yes. Colonization of other planets is the way that may save Earth. Perhaps, we will use this possibility.
earth_first_return_2.7.0=Yes. There is a solution, but I can't tell you more. As for me, the crisis doesn't frighten me anymore And you also shouldn't lose your heart.
earth_first_return_2.6.2=I guess it's too soon to be more specific. Nevertheless, I tried to present our nation well-developed and peaceful, deserving a long-term and productive cooperation. I sincerely hope that I managed to do it.
earth_first_return_2.6.1=You may say we just took a closer look, but nothing more happened. Sure, eventually we're going to build stronger and more stable connections or, probably, even organize business. It's a matter of time.
earth_first_return_2.6.0=Nothing specific. There were simple sessions of information exchage. I suppose in some way they didn't care a dime. I believe soon things will change, but now it is what it is.
earth_first_return_2.5.0=I think you don't need to watch so many movies. Make your question more specific.
earth_first_return_2.4.0=...
earth_first_return_2.3.2=We're not the only ones in the Universe. It's hard to say if it is good or not, it's the fact. And, perhaps, some of you will find alien traditions a bit weird, but that's okay.
earth_first_return_2.3.1=\"Yes, we had a contact with aliens. There were not so many of them but the communiction was successful. As for the \"\"interplanetary relationship\"\"... I'm so sorry, but I didn't understand your question, to be honest.  \"
earth_first_return_2.3.0=Sure, I did meet them. Or, wait, do you mean something different? Yuck!
earth_first_return_2.12.0=...
earth_first_return_2.2.2=It's not only about me. Although I'm the commander and I take the responsibility, on the spaceship we're a team. Space showed us a lot: its beauty, its infinity. And the most important thing: its possibilities. It's a great word, possibilities. A great word for me, my crew and even the Earth.   
earth_first_return_2.2.1=You're too fast, without a peep. I'm confused. You know, it's hard to tell you. That wasn't my first interplanetary flight and that's why I am at a loss to answer. Space has become familiar to me, yet it has been so unknown to you. 
earth_first_return_2.2.0=Ha. How did it welcome me? Then how did terra incognita welcome Columbus? How did shores of America weclome ancient vikings? How did Mongolia welcome Marco Polo? What about aztecs and conquistadors? Well, space welcomed me with its novelty that could be a saving source for us and our planet.  
earth_first_return_2.11.0=It was. Well, I hope I won't take part in such things in the future. 
earth_first_return_2.1.0=...
earth_first_return_2.10.2=I understand your disturbance about our countrymen. And I can cheer you up -  we've found a trace of Aurora and we'll follow it soon. No matter where, the humans don't leave each other in trouble, am I right? 
earth_first_return_2.10.1=I believe that the main goal of my spaceship is looking for a way to get rid of the crisis. When we find the way we will look for the Aurora. I think this is the best decision right now. 
earth_first_return_2.10.0=My task is not finding the Aurora, but saving the planet. And pay attention, I don't say saving the humans, because it's not only about them. And if you think I should give up everything I'm working on now and start chasing a ghost\uFFFD
earth_first_return_2.9.0=...
earth_first_return_2.0.0=...
earth_first_return_2.8.1=We had to shoot a little, but nothing serious, you know. They don't like bandits, pirats and other bad men in outer space.
earth_first_return_2.8.0=Nope. However, you can't be too careful in this dangerous times. I hope you got my idea.
earth_first_return_2.9=*Next question is a surprise to you* The Aurora-1! What can you say about the Aurora-1?!*
