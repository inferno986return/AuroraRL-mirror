sstones_stone_5.1=N-n-no, Captain. We tried, but the connection to its terminal will only be established when it floats outside. Not unt-t-til then. N-n-no way. *Gordon nods.*
sstones_stone_5.3.1=*sign off*
sstones_stone_5.0=*The cargo hold camera. There is only the rock with its terminal there, nothing else. The output goes straight to the captain's computer. It's simple. All you have left to do is press the button and open the outside airlock.*
sstones_stone_5.3.0=\"Take care of yourself.\"
sstones_stone_5.4.0=I hope so, too.
sstones_stone_5.0.2=*not now*
sstones_stone_5.0.1=*open the airlock*
sstones_stone_5.0.0=Gordon, are you sure there is no way to contact it?
sstones_stone_5.1.0=*open the airlock*
sstones_stone_5.2.2=*sign off*
sstones_stone_5.2.1=\"Take care of yourself.\"
sstones_stone_5.4=*There is no answer. Although\u2026 what is that? As its last message, it decided to send this.* \"In the gardens where the irises blossom, To talk to an old friend. What a reward for the traveler!\"
sstones_stone_5.2.0=\"Are you sure? We can still catch you!\"
sstones_stone_5.3=\"It's our time, human captain. Our life, and we are doing the right thing.\"
sstones_stone_5.2=*Well, there it goes. The airlock is open. Along with the current of air rushing outside, the rock goes out, dragging the terminal after it on the sturdy cable. It's a normal sight. A simple cargo dump. But...* \"There's a connection, Captain. We're floating.\"
