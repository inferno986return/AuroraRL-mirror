heritage_klisk.0.0=What the\u2026
heritage_klisk.8.1=We're talking business, Lonroe. You wanted to offer me something.
heritage_klisk.11.0=And on the other hand?
heritage_klisk.8.0=Monsters? So there's more of these creatures?
heritage_klisk.7.1=We're talking business, Lonroe. You wanted to offer me something.
heritage_klisk.7.0=What did you do to that scientist?
heritage_klisk.10.0=In other words, you want my men to kill four Klisks?
heritage_klisk.6.2=We're talking business, Lonroe. You wanted to offer me something.
heritage_klisk.6.1=What did you do to that scientist?
heritage_klisk.6.0=Monsters? So there's more of these creatures?
heritage_klisk.5.0=Thank you. But what was the matter with it? What was that creatures? What exactly did I do to help?
heritage_klisk.4.1=What deal did you want to discuss?
heritage_klisk.4.0=Why couldn't I discuss this question with the one I was talking to before?
heritage_klisk.9=That's right. It's pretty simple, human captain. You've brought us the data thanks to which we are reasonably sure where the other four monsters might be. I propose that you find them and kill them. Believe me, you'll be well compensated for each one.
heritage_klisk.3.1=Sounds promising. So what deal did you want to discuss?
heritage_klisk.8=When he ran away, we sent a squad of Bork mercenaries after him. They boarded his ship, and accidentally shot out scientist in the head while doing it. What can you do? They're Borks. *Lonroe shakes his head.*
heritage_klisk.3.0=Who are you, anyway?
heritage_klisk.7=There was a lot of them. Now, there's four left. When it all came to light, the scientist tried to run away on a stolen ship. While on the run, he dumped five of them in escape pods, trying to save them.
heritage_klisk.6=Firstly, I regret to inform you that the creature you killed really was a Klisk. *Lonroe sighs.* It's a wild beast, human captain. A mutant. A creature with no mind or, if one may say it, a soul. A whole band of these monsters was created by one of the Vortangu Corp scientists over 15 years ago. He was experimenting with the Klisk genetic code, and this is what it led to. *The Klisk takes out a glass from somewhere, takes a sip and gathers his breath.*
heritage_klisk.5=The data you've brought. First of all, have ten credits. Trust me, you cannot even imagine how you helped us.
heritage_klisk.4=You already know my name. So the question must be about my position. *The Klisk smiles and licks his lips with the edge of his tongue.* At the Vortangu Corp, I deal with things that require immediate resolution. Guarding corporate assets, important negotiations, high priority scientific research... A lot of things, human captain.
heritage_klisk.3=Because this deal falls outside of his competence, human captain. My corporation has its own interest here.
heritage_klisk.2=So you've figured our social system out already, huh? *The Klisk smiles imposingly.* That's admirable... I like talking business with intelligent creatures. We like to say that an intelligent being becomes richer through talking with other intelligent creatures. A wealth of mind is sometimes much more important than a wealth of money.
heritage_klisk.1=*Nope, it's okay, the connection is back. Looks like they just changed the line.* Hello, human captain. *This isn't the Klisk you were previously talking to. This one looks more impressive: there are wide muscles on his soft body, and his slimy skin doesn't look repulsive: something is rubbed into it to counter the unpleasant glow. Even the interior of this Klisk's office makes it obvious that he's important.* You will be talking to me, I apologize for that momentary rudeness. *The Klisk nods* My name is Lonroe. Lonroe Vortangu.
heritage_klisk.14.0=I hope so, too.
heritage_klisk.0=Yes, human captain, data analysis is done\u2026 *The merchant looks a little worried.* And, unfortunately, I am not authorized to talk to you about it. *The image disappears.*
heritage_klisk.14=We've reached an agreement, and I'm very glad, human captain. I've already sent you the data that will help you find those monsters. I hope luck will favor you.
heritage_klisk.2.2=Glad to hear that. What deal did you want to discuss?
heritage_klisk.13=*Lonroe nods.* Your call, human captain. I guess I'll have to send the Borks again, and they'll make a bloodbath out of it again... But that's none of your business. *He signs off.*
heritage_klisk.2.1=Excuse me, but who are you, anyway?
heritage_klisk.12=And on the other hand, they're Klisks. And if they were sentient, they would be in pain, suffering from living in monsters' bodies. Whichever way you look at it, you'll help us, but you'll help them more. What do you say, human captain?
heritage_klisk.2.0=Why couldn't I discuss this question with the one I was talking to before?
heritage_klisk.11=On one hand, they aren't Klisks. They're monsters, human captain. Your men have seen and felt what those creatures are capable of. They're strong, dangerous, literally genociding all other creatures around them. That is how their mad creator made them.
heritage_klisk.10=10 credits for every body.
heritage_klisk.13.0=That's true. That is none of my business.
heritage_klisk.1.0=A Vortangu Corp representative?
heritage_klisk.9.1=In other words, you want my men to kill four Klisks?
heritage_klisk.12.1=You've convinced me. I say yes.
heritage_klisk.9.0=I want to know the exact sum of your \"compensation.\"
heritage_klisk.12.0=No. My men aren't hired killers.
