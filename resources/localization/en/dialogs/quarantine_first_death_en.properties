quarantine_first_death.999.0=What is this illness like, anyway? Symptoms, causes?
quarantine_first_death.4.2=What do you suggest we do?
quarantine_first_death.4.1=Will there be more fatalities?
quarantine_first_death.4.0=What is this illness like, anyway? Symptoms, causes?
quarantine_first_death.16.0=Wow, and I thought I was just wasting money.
quarantine_first_death.3.0=Calm down. We're alive so far. And taht means\u2026 we have to do something.
quarantine_first_death.15.0=Great!
quarantine_first_death.2.0=Okay. What do we have to do? Separate the infected from the uninfected, then go to Earth, set up a quarantine?
quarantine_first_death.14.0=That's something.
quarantine_first_death.16=Yes, we'll definitely find something there. For example, there was a description of many diseases that are dangerous for species from multiple planets. It's great that you decided to buy the data back then!
quarantine_first_death.15=Yes, Captain, that is a great module. Our sick will hold out longer with it, and data from the samples will be processed faster.
quarantine_first_death.14=Yes, I know, C-captain. The equipment there really is great! We can arrest the acute stage of the disease\u2026 but only for some time.
quarantine_first_death.13=*Gordon shrugs. He's right: how is he supposed to know that?*
quarantine_first_death.12=Yes. And it would be great if we explored the planet where we caught it, Captain. That would help for sure.
quarantine_first_death.11=Not enough data, Captain. The fauna sample we had was destroyed while we were preparing for the quarantine.
quarantine_first_death.1.0=It's bad.
quarantine_first_death.10=We have to act, Captain.
quarantine_first_death.13.0=\u2026
quarantine_first_death.9.0=Of course.
quarantine_first_death.0.0=Gordon? But the inspection isn't over yet.
quarantine_first_death.12.0=I see, Gordon.
quarantine_first_death.8.0=I don't want to find out.
quarantine_first_death.9=First of all, no docking with Earth. You understand.
quarantine_first_death.8=Can Earth build a third Aurora?
quarantine_first_death.7=Yes. The probability of death is 100%. If we don't cure ourselves\u2026 *The scientist shakes his head meaningfully.*
quarantine_first_death.6=Hard to say, Captain. It all depends on the stage of the infection, the wave from which you got infected\u2026 some will last more, some less.
quarantine_first_death.5=Something resembling plague, C-captain. Lung kind. *Gordon brings a fist up to the camera and flicks a finger.* It develops. *He flicks another one.* Reaches its acute state. *He flicks the third one.* The person can't breathe and dies. It's hard.
quarantine_first_death.4=Yes\u2026 We do\u2026 *Gordon nods. He looks doomed.*
quarantine_first_death.11.0=Got it. Do we need new ones?
quarantine_first_death.3=Captain\u2026 *Gordon sighs.* There's no one to separate. We're all sick. They have just finished the blood work, and... it's everybody. Even you. *You can see from his eyes that Gordon is barely holding back his panic.*
quarantine_first_death.2=Yes. This\u2026 is some kind of illness. Another man died. There can be no doubt about it.
quarantine_first_death.1=*Gordon nods silently. His expression doesn't look too good, and he himself looks extremely tired: swollen bags under his eyes, gray skin... It's obvious.*
quarantine_first_death.0=*Gordon hails you once more, and again over the urgent channel.*
quarantine_first_death.7.0=An empty ship in outer space\u2026
quarantine_first_death.10.5=Okay. We've got no time to waste. Get back to your duties and wait for my orders. Over and out, Gordon.
quarantine_first_death.10.4=We have the advanced medical bay, Gordon\u2026 Can it help?
quarantine_first_death.10.3=We have the experimental module for the medical bay installed, Gordon\u2026 Could it help?
quarantine_first_death.10.2=Can we buy the medicine?
quarantine_first_death.10.1=Remember buying data on extraterrestrial biology from the aliens? Can it help us?
quarantine_first_death.10.0=Gordon, you're head of a cutting edge science department. Can't you figure out how to cure this crap?
quarantine_first_death.999=*Gordon is waiting silently.*
quarantine_first_death.6.0=Hm\u2026
quarantine_first_death.5.0=How much time do we have left?
quarantine_first_death.999.2=What do you suggest we do?
quarantine_first_death.999.1=Will there be more fatalities?
