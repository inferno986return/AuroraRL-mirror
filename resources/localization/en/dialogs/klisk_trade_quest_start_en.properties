klisk_trade_quest_start.2.0=Are you expecting an attack?
klisk_trade_quest_start.4.2=Are you expecting an attack?
klisk_trade_quest_start.4.1=That's right. Is the cargo that important?
klisk_trade_quest_start.4.0=I think it's time to take off.
klisk_trade_quest_start.6.0=Are you okay?
klisk_trade_quest_start.8.0=Okay, let's take off.
klisk_trade_quest_start.1.3=Exactly. Let's not waste any time. Are we taking off?
klisk_trade_quest_start.1.2=Where are we going, anyway?
klisk_trade_quest_start.1.1=Are you expecting an attack?
klisk_trade_quest_start.8=*Dlorou gets angry.* Trust me, that's exactly what it is. I'll know. The Code says that he who treats himself too softly becomes soft.
klisk_trade_quest_start.1.0=That's right. Is the cargo that important?
klisk_trade_quest_start.7=A bit under the weather. Don't pay it any mind.
klisk_trade_quest_start.6=Yeah. *The Klisk lets out muffed grunts. You can hear sloshing and cracking in his antennae.*
klisk_trade_quest_start.3.2=Trash? Not important cargo?
klisk_trade_quest_start.4=A small co-owned station at the orbit of star XH-201, its coordinates are ${klisk_trade.coords}. We co-own it with the Rogues. The station and the system.
klisk_trade_quest_start.3.1=I think it's time to take off.
klisk_trade_quest_start.3=No, of course not. *Dlorou tries to click, but he can't, his body just shudders a little.* What attack? The Borks only attack rich caravans... What we're carrying is trash to them.
klisk_trade_quest_start.3.0=Where are we going, anyway?
klisk_trade_quest_start.2=*Dlorou clicks in surprise.* Important cargo? Why would you think that? It's trash ready for recycling. Spare parts for heave machinery. Second-hand microchips. Some raw oil for scientific experiments.
klisk_trade_quest_start.1=*The escort leaves and the Klisk floats over to you. Up close you can see that he's not all well: his hand is trembling, his antennae are jerking slightly, and his eyes are bloodshot.* I'm Dlorou Harten. Or just Dlorou. You're the human captain, I know that. You're to escort us.
klisk_trade_quest_start.0=*The escort takes you to the dock where you witnessed a heated argument on the way to Eroloa. There is some kind of shuttle there, too. Next to it is a Klisk on a richly decorated antigrav. Apparently, he's waiting for you.*
klisk_trade_quest_start.7.1=Okay, let's take off.
klisk_trade_quest_start.7.0=It doesn't look like you're just a bit under the weather.
klisk_trade_quest_start.0.0=\u2026
klisk_trade_quest_start.2.2=I think it's time to take off.
