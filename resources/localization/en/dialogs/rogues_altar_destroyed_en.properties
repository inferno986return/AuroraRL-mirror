rogues_altar_destroyed.2.0=Right. I have business to attend to.
rogues_altar_destroyed.0=I know there was a fight on the Moon. Report.
rogues_altar_destroyed.1.0=Of course not. Maybe I was being rash, but first, I can't undo it. And second, a peaceful solution isn't always the right one.
rogues_altar_destroyed.0.0=Well, there's nothing to report. The Rogues wouldn't leave, and they refused to disassemble their Altar, too. We could have tried to help them fix it or go to their leader and make an arrangement, but I didn't want to waste any time.
rogues_altar_destroyed.2=Wise words. I won't keep you.
rogues_altar_destroyed.1=Good decision. We don't need another hurricane. You don't regret doing it that way?
