gordon_science_theories_first.6.1=I'm sorry, Gordon, but our mission objectives are different. Getting that data isn't our first priority. I'll have to refuse.
gordon_science_theories_first.6.0=It's serious, then\u2026 Okay. I'll try to buy something as soon as I can.
gordon_science_theories_first.8.1=I'm glad you understand. Over and out.
gordon_science_theories_first.8.0=Oh, will you look at that. He's offended. We only need to save the planet, because without it, there won't be any goddamn human science!
gordon_science_theories_first.10.0=Granted. Over and out.
gordon_science_theories_first.9=That's not what I meant!
gordon_science_theories_first.8=*Gordon nods and adjusts his glasses.* Yes\u2026 Of course, Captain. I understand. It's science, you can't eat it with a side of salad! *He looks irritated.*
gordon_science_theories_first.1.0=Don't be sour. What did you want?
gordon_science_theories_first.7=Really? Captain! Thank you! This\u2026 this\u2026 *The sound goes away again, and you can't hear Gordon anymore.*
gordon_science_theories_first.6=*Gordon shakes his head and reaches for his neck with his hand. He looks a bit simple.* If you want to know if w-w-we can make a big blaster or something based on that technology... *He shakes his head again.* No. This is theoretical knowledge, they're much more valuable than any short-term practical benefit. This is science, Captain.
gordon_science_theories_first.10=*Gordon's eyes glisten. He says this biting his lip.* Pardon me. It won't happen again. Permission to get back to my duties?
gordon_science_theories_first.5=*He doesn't pay you any mind.* ...or, for example, the problem of the symmetry of electroweak interaction! It looks like they figured the mechanism of calibrating symmetry of W and Z bosons a long time ago! Huh?... What? Oh... *He nods.* C-c-captain! You simply must buy the research data in the name of human science! Any data! Biological, chemical... any kind at all!
gordon_science_theories_first.4=Sh-sh-shop! They... it's... fantastic! The aliens' view on projective algebraic manifolds is stunning, and very precise! Their methods of approximation of objects to such high powers... too bad... *Gordon shakes his head.* We could have solved it... solve for special cases... *It looks like he's retreated into himself.*
gordon_science_theories_first.3=Oh! *Gordon looks crazy again.* The technologies we saw! The sh-sh-sh-sh\u2026 sh-sh\u2026
gordon_science_theories_first.3.0=Shop. What exactly did you want to buy?
gordon_science_theories_first.2=*He nods, disconnects and calls you again in a couple of seconds.* Uh\u2026 I h-h-have some communication p-p-problems. The sound g-g-goes away at times.
gordon_science_theories_first.1=*Gordon suddenly stops talking and his face becomes round. He disconnects and calls you again in a couple of seconds.* You c-c-could have told me I didn't have sound, Captain. Did you have to make fun of me?
gordon_science_theories_first.0=*You get a call from Gordon. He's looking at the camera crazily and telling you about something while gesticulating a lot. There is no sound, though. Which makes him look pretty funny.*
gordon_science_theories_first.5.1=It's hard to argue with you. Okay, I'll get to it.
gordon_science_theories_first.5.0=\"In the name of human science,\" then. What is the pragmatic value of it?
gordon_science_theories_first.7.0=Right. I understood, but you need to get your comms fixed. Over and out, Gordon.
gordon_science_theories_first.9.0=And I meant exactly what I said. Right now we need a good blaster more than potentially useful information. And if you don't understand that, Gordon, what the hell are you doing here?
gordon_science_theories_first.0.1=I can't hear you, Gordon.
gordon_science_theories_first.0.0=*gesticulate in response*
gordon_science_theories_first.2.0=Talk to Tech about it. What did you want, Gordon?
gordon_science_theories_first.4.0=Gordon\u2026 Gordon!
