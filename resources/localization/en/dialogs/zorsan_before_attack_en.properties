zorsan_before_attack.10.0=I didn't know.
zorsan_before_attack.20.0=A living being isn't alive due to technology. Don't you think you should look at the profitability of our cooperation from this side as well?
zorsan_before_attack.28=Oh. Just like I suspected. You've already categorized yourself as the worst, despite my never having said th- *He is interrupted with a call from a device that is essentially a phone. The Zorsan picks up the receiver and says something into it. Having hung up, he says.* Well, now it's all sorted out. *He walks up to the window and opens it. The room is immediately filled with noise from the street and the stench of something burning.*
zorsan_before_attack.27=Oh, you don't know? You're so\u2026 You'll find out. Some day. Or maybe you won't, that won't surprise me.
zorsan_before_attack.26=The Code of Commerce. A thing that couldn't have been created naturally. A people stupid enough to allow external influence is worthy only of contempt.
zorsan_before_attack.25=Forty percent. It's something genetic. I call it the brand of their fate, you know.
zorsan_before_attack.24=What do you think? There is an obvious reason. And it is simple: we are better. Better than the Borks, 40% of whom are idiots and fools. Better than the Klisks, the gut-legged creatures following some stupid... Code! Better than the Rogues, whose central object of worship is - just think about this! - The Obliterator!
zorsan_before_attack.23=Oh! You've done your homework. *The Zorsan laughs.* Yes, you could call that a reason... the Borks. Fools and imbeciles. And about Klisks and Rogues... What? Do their looks not offend the eye? Are their customs and way of life not strange? 
zorsan_before_attack.22=Oh, come on now! You're trying to work with high concepts, but that's just empty words! *A phone rings, or something that acts like one here. The Zorsan listens intently, then hangs up. After that, he walks up to the window and opens it. The inside becomes very noisy, just like the street. A rank stench of something burning fills the room.*
zorsan_before_attack.21=Oh, you're speaking about culture. When I hear that word, I reach for my gun. How would that be profitable, pray tell? That's a good question. What is the benefit of a cooperation between someone weak and someone strong? Between your people and mine?
zorsan_before_attack.20=Well, there is some truth to what you're saying. The rate of our technological advancement really is higher than that of the Klisks, Borks, or Rogues. And definitely higher than yours.
zorsan_before_attack.19=Trust me, human captain... It's not like that. The worse one will never catch up with the better one. *He is interrupted by a call from something that acts as a teleophone. Having finished his conversation, the Zorsan looks at you again.* Something has changed. Look. *He walks up to the window and opens it. The noise from the street fills the room, along with a stuffy stench that smells like something that burned.*
zorsan_before_attack.18=Why not? Let's be honest, there are always ones that are better. Simply better. And it's obvious that in an uneven alliance, the worse one will benefit, not the better one. Tell me, how would we benefit from a relationship with you?
zorsan_before_attack.17=Yes. Every side has something to say. Maybe they're just less developed than us? Or maybe we're just better? Who knows?
zorsan_before_attack.16=*You can hear yelling and noise. Loud footsteps. An alarm is sounded in a few seconds.*
zorsan_before_attack.15=*That was an obvious signal. Punching the Zorsan diplomat in the face was another one. When you turn around, you see that your troops have already dealt with the enemy guards and gotten their weapons. You'll definitely have to give Liszkiewicz a bonus now.* What now, Captain?
zorsan_before_attack.14=Of course not. Even in the best case scenario, we'd just kick you out of our system disgraced. The Zorsan don't like foreigners, human captain. Especially ones like you. A bad, tasteless parody of us. A sign of what we could have become had we not been us.
zorsan_before_attack.13=*The Zorsan gets back behind the desk and presses the top again. The door opens with a crack. Several Zorsan wearing blue robes and holding weapons run inside. They quickly train their sights on you.* And the question is, I want to know the coordinates of your planet.
zorsan_before_attack.12=You've done your homework. Maybe you aren't a dumb savage after all. *The Zorsan smiles.* Sorry for being so blunt. I'll ask one more question, and then we'll be done, I promise.
zorsan_before_attack.11=Now you do. The information you've provided is pretty interesting. The information you've provided is very interesting. But there is one more thing I'd like to know.
zorsan_before_attack.10=Definitely. And it's all the sadder for me. Zorsan is my home, after all. A great planet, a great empire... *He shakes his head, then sighs and retreats into himself for some time. The next thing he says is very sudden.* Judging from the data you've provided, our planets are very similar. Zorsan and Earth. They aren't exact copies, of course, but in terms of planetary structure, fossils, flora... Although we don't have much of the latter left, as you can see.
zorsan_before_attack.9.0=That's very sad.
zorsan_before_attack.8.0=I'm sorry.
zorsan_before_attack.7.1=From what I've been able to see, your ecological situation really is rather drastic.
zorsan_before_attack.7.0=I don't. I've barely seen it.
zorsan_before_attack.6.0=\u2026
zorsan_before_attack.5.2=Of course, we'd be the ones to benefit from it more. Which isn't strange, since it's not easy for humans to catch up with a species as developed as yours. But there are things where we can be considered equals. Culture, for example.
zorsan_before_attack.19.0=\u2026
zorsan_before_attack.5.1=Peaceful cooperation is a good basis for development. We'll both benefit from it, provided that you want that to happen.
zorsan_before_attack.5.0=Well, I don't know. It's obvious that are peoples have more in common with each other than with the others. I think it's pretty solid grounds for an alliance. Like, say, a military alliance.
zorsan_before_attack.18.2=Cooperating with someone who is better than you makes you better. But you are too strict. You put technological development higher than cultural development, or any other kind.
zorsan_before_attack.18.1=Peace is always profitable. A relationship between unequal partners only stimulates the less productive one to work harder.
zorsan_before_attack.18.0=Right. Am I hearing things or did you just outright say that my people is worse than yours? That's pretty bold. There's a lot more similarities between us than things that are different. And we will both benefit from it, be the alliance peaceful or military.
zorsan_before_attack.4.0=Let's say I know what you're talking about. But you still haven't told me if I'm right.
zorsan_before_attack.3.3=I know about the recent conflict with the Borks, so we have an answer concerning them, at least. Although I'd be surprised to find out that there is someone in space who HASN'T been in a conflict with them. Anyway. What about the Klisks and the Rogues? They don't look like they like war or intrigue.
zorsan_before_attack.28.0=\u2026
zorsan_before_attack.3.2=Maybe, you're so advanced you don't think it's necessary?
zorsan_before_attack.3.1=I'll abstain from answering. I think there are a lot of reasons and every side has something to say.
zorsan_before_attack.17.0=I definitely don't. And categories like \"better\" or \"worse\" aren't fit for this type of comparison.
zorsan_before_attack.3.0=You seem like an arrogant creature. If all of your people are like that, there's your answer. Sorry for being so blunt.
zorsan_before_attack.27.2=All right, enough! I'm tired of listening to this. This is the definition of chauvinism!
zorsan_before_attack.27.1=The Klisk Code?
zorsan_before_attack.27.0=The Borks are fools and imbeciles?
zorsan_before_attack.16.0=And now, we have to run. To the hangar, then the shuttle, and get the hell out of here before they realize what's happening. Damn it, that's not how I imagined it would happen.
zorsan_before_attack.2.0=Done.
zorsan_before_attack.26.2=All right, enough! I'm tired of listening to this. This is the definition of chauvinism!
zorsan_before_attack.26.1=The Obliterator? What is it?
zorsan_before_attack.26.0=The Borks are fools and imbeciles?
zorsan_before_attack.15.0=\u2026
zorsan_before_attack.1.0=That's right. And we're ready to send over some introductory information about us. Our planet, our technology, ourselves... It's a short description to provide you with first impressions.
zorsan_before_attack.25.2=All right, enough! I'm tired of listening to this. This is the definition of chauvinism!
zorsan_before_attack.25.1=The Obliterator? What is it?
zorsan_before_attack.25.0=The Klisk Code?
zorsan_before_attack.14.0=Okay. Now!
zorsan_before_attack.0.0=In that case, you don't need mine either. I represent my people. We are humans, homo sapiens. We're from planet Earth.
zorsan_before_attack.24.3=All right, enough! I'm tired of listening to this. This is the definition of chauvinism!
zorsan_before_attack.24.2=The Obliterator? What is it?
zorsan_before_attack.24.1=The Klisk Code?
zorsan_before_attack.24.0=The Borks are fools and imbeciles?
zorsan_before_attack.13.0=Obviously, there isn't going to be any cooperation between us.
zorsan_before_attack.23.0=What are you hinting at?
zorsan_before_attack.12.0=\u2026
zorsan_before_attack.9=Yes. Technological advancement has forced us to sacrifice some things. I think you've realized what they were by now.
zorsan_before_attack.8=You should be more observant in new places. Speaking simply, yes, my planet really is dying.
zorsan_before_attack.7=This smell is everywhere in our cities. Superstitious old men say that it's the stench of rotting soil. They think our planet is dead and it's decomposing. What do you think of our planet?
zorsan_before_attack.6=Military alliance? *The Zorsan smiles again.* You say that as if you haven't s- *He is interrupted by a phone call. Or at least the device looks like a phone. The Zorsan picks up the receiver and listens intently.* But, that doesn't matter anymore. You know, I want to tell you about planet Zorsan. *He walks up to the window and opens it. The room is immediately filled with car noises and the smell of something burning.*
zorsan_before_attack.22.0=\u2026
zorsan_before_attack.11.0=\u2026
zorsan_before_attack.5=In part. Continuing on. So, if the Zorsan don't have any contact with the three main developed space species, why do you think we'll want to have a relationship with you?
zorsan_before_attack.4=*The Zorsan smiles. The smile looks unpleasant on his meaty face.* Oh. You have an opinion. You're even trying to be deep about it. I'm arrogant? Could be. Only those who have nothing to be proud of aren't. What, you've never been proud of your people? Your planet?
zorsan_before_attack.3=Now, I want to ask you a question. I don't know if you're aware, but the Zorsan don't have a special relationship with anybody. Not the Borks, not the Klisks, not the Rogues. Not even the Gardeners. Why do you think that is?
zorsan_before_attack.2=Send it over. *The Zorsan presses the top of the desk, revealing some kind of computer.* I've opened the channel. I'll transfer it right to the Imperial Department of Intelligence and Logistics, if you're curious... Right.
zorsan_before_attack.21.2=Your gun? Funny. You completely dismiss the value of cooperation between two different cultures, even though it affects every aspect of life. Technology included.
zorsan_before_attack.1=Never heard of it. And I'd probably prefer not to hear about it, given the choice. I received a report saying that you got here with a diplomatic mission.
zorsan_before_attack.21.1=I'll let your insult slide. Only the cooperation between two unequal parties is truly productive. It's great motivation for both of them.
zorsan_before_attack.10.1=Yes, there are some similarities. Although there is much more water on Earth.
zorsan_before_attack.0=*The room is very dark. It looks depressing, but the Zorsan like this style, apparently. Speaking of the Zorsan: there is one standing behind a high desk. Judging from his robe with patterns of the color of red gold, his rank is pretty high.* So, it's you. I expected to see someone who looked... less like us. I'm the Imperial Diplomatic Representative. You don't need my name yet.
zorsan_before_attack.21.0=I'd choose my words more carefully if I were you. Strong and weak, that's a very harsh comparison. Humans are a pretty developed people. And you would benefit from an alliance with us, be it peaceful or military.
