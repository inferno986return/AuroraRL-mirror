heritage_klisk_final.5.0=Of course. Over and out.
heritage_klisk_final.11.1=That's none of your business.
heritage_klisk_final.11.0=Could be. But probably not. It's intelligent.
heritage_klisk_final.4.0=And a long time before we came, too. It slit its own throat. And it was trying to write poetry.
heritage_klisk_final.10.0=So that's how it is. He really got mad.
heritage_klisk_final.3.0=Doing a good thing? I really hope I am. Over and out.
heritage_klisk_final.16=*Lonroe is annoyed. His skin is covered in big drops of slime.* Yes. You're right. *His answers sound like hissing.* This is unethical. Let it be like that. Keep that creature. You won't get any money for it, of course. And you don't look like you need it, anyway. *The connection drops. Looks like someone disconnected too quickly.*
heritage_klisk_final.15=*Lonroe leans back and smiles.* It's a good thing you changed your mind. Trust me, we won't harm that creature. As for you... You deserve a bonus. You're one of the best investments ever made by the Vortangu Corp.
heritage_klisk_final.14=In that case, you must hand it over to us. It is our corporate asset. We can study it, help it... Human captain, you're making a mistake!
heritage_klisk_final.13=*Lonroe nods. His voice is quiet and silky.* Looks like the rumors about you were greatly exaggerated, Captain\u2026 *He shakes his head and signs off.*
heritage_klisk_final.2.0=Pleasure to work with you.
heritage_klisk_final.12=You're right, it is. I guess it's no use telling you that you're holding corporate assets... Let it be like that, human captain. You aren't getting paid for your voyage, I think that much is obvious.
heritage_klisk_final.11=So what are you going to do with it, human captain? *Lonroe laughs.* Sic it on your enemies like a pet animal?
heritage_klisk_final.10=Let it rest in peace, then. *Lonroe is annoyed, he draws his speech slowly and petulantly.* I think you understand that I cannot pay for such a voyage. There is nothing to pay you for. There is nothing to discuss there. It was a pleasure to work with you, human captain. Not as good as I expected, but pleasant. *The connection breaks. Lonroe simply signed off.*
heritage_klisk_final.1.0=Of course. Over and out.
heritage_klisk_final.16.0=If he doesn't calm down, he'll explode all over his office. His office is cool. I'd like one like that... hm... Maybe I could ask Sarah to renovate my quarters\u2026
heritage_klisk_final.9=*Lonroe frowns.*
heritage_klisk_final.8=So that's how it is... So, after all... Ahem. *Lonroe leans back and smiles.* This is just wonderful news, human captain. You deserve a bonus. You're one of the best investments ever made by the Vortangu Corp.
heritage_klisk_final.7=What? Are you sure about that? *Lonroe leans forward, he's shocked.*
heritage_klisk_final.6=Yes?
heritage_klisk_final.5=*Lonroe clicks a sad, somber rhythm.* Too bad. Maybe it really was intelligent. I hope we can find that out soon through studying its corpse. Here's your money.
heritage_klisk_final.9.0=We searched the whole planet, combed it with scanners. Nothing. Looks like it managed to climb into some deep hole and die there.
heritage_klisk_final.0.4=About the fourth creature\u2026
heritage_klisk_final.4=Really? Are you serious?
heritage_klisk_final.0.3=The third one\u2026 It's going to be funny, but it killed itself.
heritage_klisk_final.3=But still, it attacked your people, Captain. That means it wasn't intelligent. Don't let your conscience eat you from the inside, my friend. You're doing a good thing. Send the corpse to me and I'll transfer you the money.
heritage_klisk_final.0.2=My men shot the second monster. Did you know it burned some words in the walls of his lair with acid?
heritage_klisk_final.2=Great, simply wonderful! Send the corpse over, and I'll transfer you the money.
heritage_klisk_final.0.1=First monster is done.
heritage_klisk_final.1=Then come back when you have some! Don't waste my time and your own, Captain.
heritage_klisk_final.0.0=Not yet, I have no bodies.
heritage_klisk_final.15.0=Glad to hear that. Over and out, Lonroe.
heritage_klisk_final.0=You're back, Captain! *Lonroe looks at you extremely satisfied.* You've completed your assignment, yes?
heritage_klisk_final.8.0=Glad to hear that. Always a pleasure to work with people like you.
heritage_klisk_final.14.1=It wanted to stay. I can't force it to go.
heritage_klisk_final.14.0=You're right. You know what\u2026 take it, after all.
heritage_klisk_final.7.0=Absolutely. I had a long conversation with it. There's definitely something wrong with its head, but I wouldn't call it stupid.
heritage_klisk_final.13.0=They say a lot of things about me. Although\u2026 He can't hear me anyway.
heritage_klisk_final.6.2=I decided to keep it.
heritage_klisk_final.6.1=My people couldn't find it.
heritage_klisk_final.6.0=I brought it alive. It's intelligent.
heritage_klisk_final.12.0=I didn't expect anything different.
