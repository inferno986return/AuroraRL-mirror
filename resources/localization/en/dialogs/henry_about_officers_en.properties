henry_about_officers.1=*Henry nods.* He acts strange, stutters a bit, is married to his job. It's as if he was the inspiration for all the clich\u00E9s. Do I think it's normal? Not exactly. Do I think Gordon is a bad crew member? No, he's doing great.  
henry_about_officers.0=Got you, Captain. And about Gordon, well\u2026 weirdly enough, he's a typical scientist. Too typical, even. 
henry_about_officers.2.0=What about Sarah Frontz?
henry_about_officers.3.0=Is she a good crew member?
henry_about_officers.4.1=That was unexpected. I should go and spend some time alone, thinking about what makes me so weird. Over and out, Liszkiewicz. 
henry_about_officers.4.0=Oh, so that's how it is? I'll keep that in mind. But let's forget about our quirks for a minute and discuss something else. 
henry_about_officers.0.0=Too typical?
henry_about_officers.4=She is. But that religion of hers makes her a bit odd. No, I don't mean it like that. I believe in God too, I'm Catholic, but... *Henry frowns and grimaces.* Forget it. I'm too suspicious. After all, we all have our quirks. And, with all due respect, so do you, Captain.
henry_about_officers.1.0=But you don't think he's normal.
henry_about_officers.3=I think she's very lucky, she got a job like that while being so young. However, I know she's considered a genius in her field. So it's not exactly surprising. *Henry is quiet for a bit, then he continues.* And also she doesn't work on Saturdays, and keeps giving us ethnic food. She even brought us some cookies. Very tasty. 
henry_about_officers.2=Henry nods again.*
