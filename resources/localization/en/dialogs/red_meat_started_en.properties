red_meat_started.16=Captain, are you serious? We gathered valuable data about that nasty thing and never put the ship in danger. And we get the brig for that?!
red_meat_started.15=Roger that. Ready to assume responsibility and go there right away.
red_meat_started.14=Of course not! As Gordon said, no port is going to let us dock with that crap on our hull. So before we go back to Earth or visit the aliens, we better find a way to get rid of it. But as of right now, we might as well leave it be, we could use some extra defense. 
red_meat_started.10.2=I hope you really knew what you were doing.
red_meat_started.13=About 10%. Not much, but it can help us in a critical situation. 
red_meat_started.10.1=This is an open violation of the regulations. You were to notify me, and I am the only one who can authorize such experiments. And for such insubordination, the regulations say you deserve time in the brig. Both of you. 
red_meat_started.12=That nasty thing... Eww... Well, it blocks our shots pretty well. Not as well as an armored hull, but it can weaken a laser beam considerably, and absorb the shock from small debris and meteorites. All in all, our hull has become a bit tougher.
red_meat_started.10.0=Next time, tell me about such experiments beforehand.
red_meat_started.11=Of course. It's just that this time, it was a spur-of-the-moment idea.
red_meat_started.10=It was my responsibility, Captain. Miss Frontz and I know exactly how much pressure we can put on the hull without damaging it, so the ship was never in any danger. 
red_meat_started.3.0=What do you mean, and that's it?
red_meat_started.18.0=So what did you find out?
red_meat_started.2.0=And?
red_meat_started.17.0=Tell me what you found out first.
red_meat_started.1.0=All right, calm down.
red_meat_started.16.1=Yes, I'm serious. A breach of subordination and putting the ship in danger has to be punished. Here, hundreds of light years away from home, we can't afford losing discipline. I'm very sorry, but it's your own fault.
red_meat_started.16.0=You're right, Sarah. Let's pretend it was a joke. Spill it, what did you find out? 
red_meat_started.9=*Sarah is obviously embarrassed.* W-well, it wasn't shooting it, exactly\u2026
red_meat_started.8=Cap, sorry for butting in. Henry and I have been studying the ship weapons' effect on that thing.
red_meat_started.7=Well... *Gordon feels that he's under fire and shrinks away from the camera.* We can't do anything about it, Captain! We tried to clean it off, but it grows back pretty much right away! It can survive in outer space, Captain, what can we do?!! We can't hit the entire surface of the biomass!!
red_meat_started.6=Exactly! *Nods.* No harm! We can just go on!
red_meat_started.5=*Gordon nods.* It's a very complex structure. It can't be deciphered... and we have world-class labs. We managed to understand only that the biomass is completely harmless for the ship. Well, apart from making the hull dirty. And we better not go to Earth with it...
red_meat_started.9.0=\u2026
red_meat_started.4=And that's it. It's not trying to do anything. It just stuck to the hull.
red_meat_started.3=And that's it.
red_meat_started.2=We don't really know, Captain. Some biomass. Some kind of fungus. It bypassed our shields, stuck to the hull, and\u2026 
red_meat_started.1=*Gordon falters.* Well\u2026 we\u2026 C-C-Captain, it's\u2026 *He gets nervous.* 
red_meat_started.0.0=Would you kindly explain the thing I see out of my window?
red_meat_started.0=You called, C-C-C-Captain?
red_meat_started.15.1=Yes, that's a good idea. Cool off for a day in there. And you too, Sarah.
red_meat_started.15.0=Negative. You're more useful to me at work than in the brig. What did you find out? 
red_meat_started.8.1=What was the result?
red_meat_started.8.0=What, you shot your own ship? Without my authorization?
red_meat_started.14.0=All right, I'll think about it. Over and out.
red_meat_started.7.0=We can probably do something. I'll try to come up with something. And meanwhile\u2026 meanwhile we can go on.
red_meat_started.13.0=So what you're suggesting is not cleaning it off?
red_meat_started.6.0=Wait, wait, wait. So you suggest we fly around with THAT on our hull? 
red_meat_started.12.0=How much tougher?
red_meat_started.5.0=Gordon, the Aurora 2 isn't capable of atmospheric flight anyway. It'll fall apart under its own weight. 
red_meat_started.11.0=So what did you find out?
red_meat_started.18=Of course, Captain. We would never have done it if we weren't sure about the consequences.
red_meat_started.17=God damn it, I didn't expect this from you, Cap. Henry, will you keep the lady company? I'll get bored if I get stuck in there alone. 
red_meat_started.4.0=Have you studied the biomass?
