zorsan_battle_after_voyager.3=Well\u2026 *Jasper shrugs, his expression is strange.* It was surprisingly safe. I thought it was going to look more like war, you know? And it was pretty quiet. Flashes here and there, and then it was over.
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.2=We're expecting intelligence from you. Of course. Are you going already or did you want to ask something?
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.1=You too. *Jasper smiles.* Right\u2026 The Voyager is a powerful thing. It's weird to feel all that power under my command. 
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.0=*Jasper Byrne looks just like he looked before: a bit unkempt and soft.* Captain! We did it, can you imagine?
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.0.0=Yeah. It's over. Good job, Jasper.
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.2.2=I'm going. Well, then, good luck. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.2.1=How are you feeling? It was pretty tense.
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.2.0=How was the fight, Captain Byrne?
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.4.1=I'm going. Well, then, good luck. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.4.0=How are you feeling? It was pretty tense.
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.6.2=I'm going. Well, then, good luck. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.6.1=How are you feeling? It was pretty tense.
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.6.0=How was the fight, Captain Byrne?
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.1.0=You'll get used to it. Have you gotten orders from the command?
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.3.0=That must be because you're behind the armor of a flagship.
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.5.0=You're a scary man, Captain Byrne.
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.6=*Jasper shrugs and smiles softly, half-embarrassed.*
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.5=No. I never felt any real danger. I felt very distant from all that\u2026 We got hit a few times, of course, but I can't really tell you anything about that.
zorsan_battle_after_voyager.4=That's right. But you aren't exactly naked out there in deep space, either, Captain.
