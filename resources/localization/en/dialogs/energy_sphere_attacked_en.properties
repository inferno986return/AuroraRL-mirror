energy_sphere_attacked.9.3=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.9.2=Look, if this sphere is so passionate about our terminal, just turn it off. Maybe this thing will fly away?
energy_sphere_attacked.9.1=*touch the sphere, too*
energy_sphere_attacked.9.0=*take your gun out and shoot the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.8.1=Well, shoo it off! Shoot it, push it\u2026 How do you work with those disgusting things?
energy_sphere_attacked.8.0=So what do we do with it?
energy_sphere_attacked.7.1=Why do you even think this sphere is alive?
energy_sphere_attacked.7.0=So what do we do with it?
energy_sphere_attacked.6.2=Well, shoo it off! Shoot it, push it\u2026 How do you work with those disgusting things?
energy_sphere_attacked.6.1=Why do you even think this sphere is alive?
energy_sphere_attacked.6.0=And what do we do with it?

energy_sphere_attacked.17.0=No, I have some more!
energy_sphere_attacked.3.1=Well, get that \"something\" off, then, Gordon! Can't you do anything yourselves?
energy_sphere_attacked.3.0=Wow, I really have to see it. I'm on my way.
energy_sphere_attacked.27.2=Damn it. We definitely have to find something out about this thing. But from who? Okay, I'll think this over in my office. Meanwhile, set up a watch.
energy_sphere_attacked.16.3=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.27.1=*touch the sphere*

energy_sphere_attacked.16.1=*touch the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.16.0=*shoot it for the eighth time*
energy_sphere_attacked.2.1=Wait. And why are you calling me? It's not safe. Contact Liszkiewicz, isolate the computer\u2026 Well, follow the procedure.
energy_sphere_attacked.26.3=I see, it was useless. We definitely have to find something out about that thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.2.0=Wow, I really have to see it. I'm on my way.
energy_sphere_attacked.26.2=Okay. Apparently, this thing powers the terminal.
energy_sphere_attacked.15.3=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.26.1=*touch the sphere*

energy_sphere_attacked.15.1=*touch the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.15.0=*bang!*
energy_sphere_attacked.1.1=What do you mean, I have to see it? Be more precise.
energy_sphere_attacked.1.0=All right, I'll be right over. I hope it's REALLY important.
energy_sphere_attacked.14.3=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.14.2=Look, if this sphere is so passionate about our terminal, just turn it off. Maybe this thing will fly away?
energy_sphere_attacked.25.0=Well, see?
energy_sphere_attacked.14.1=*touch the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.14.0=*shot number six*
energy_sphere_attacked.24.3=Okay, damn it, whatever. We definitely have to find something out about that thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.0.0=Will you look at that. What happened there?
energy_sphere_attacked.24.2=Turn off the terminal! That's an order.
energy_sphere_attacked.13.3=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.24.1=*touch the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.13.2=Look, if this sphere is so passionate about our terminal, just turn it off. Maybe this thing will fly away?
energy_sphere_attacked.24.0=*take out your gun and shoot the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.13.1=*touch the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.27=*Gordon nods. The scientists are silent. The soldiers look at the terminal with some sort of religious fervor.*
energy_sphere_attacked.13.0=*fifth time*
energy_sphere_attacked.26=*And see they do. They see the sphere latch back onto the terminal after it turns on again. Gordon's face widens, he jumps up to the back panel and quickly plucks away every power cable he can. It's useless. The terminal boots up again and starts analyzing the data.* 
energy_sphere_attacked.25=*Gordon personally turns off the main research terminal. As soon as the server lights stop blinking, the sphere shakes slightly, but visibly. It swiftly goes to the side, and then up. It looks like it's about to leave.*
energy_sphere_attacked.23.3=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.24=*There is no definite answer. The responsibility, as always, lies on the boss.* 
energy_sphere_attacked.23.2=Wait. And if this creature breaks something? Something serious? 
energy_sphere_attacked.12.3=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.23=*Dead silence falls on the scientists. Gordon is talking for everyone.* But... but there's research going on there! It'll ruin all of our work! Calculations, notes, monitoring data... We'll have to do it all over again! 
energy_sphere_attacked.23.1=*touch the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.12.2=Look, if this sphere is so passionate about our terminal, just turn it off. Maybe this thing will fly away?
energy_sphere_attacked.23.0=*take out your gun and shoot the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.22=Uhm... *The old man is confused. He plucks at a lock of his gray hair nervously, adjusts his scarf and his hat... Is that how scientists dress? Will you look at that! He has Ph.D., but he looks like a redneck.* Honestly, these are just my conjectures. I may be wrong, but... I think it's some other kind of life form. So different we simply cannot make contact. *Right after this phrase the scientists start a lively discussion, which gradually turns into an intellectual shouting fest, and then into uppity quacking.* 
energy_sphere_attacked.12.1=*touch the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.21=*One of the scientists answers. It's some shabbily dressed old man with a very young look in his eyes.* We are only reading standard behavioral reactions, Captain. It just proves that it's alive. We haven't found out anything else.
energy_sphere_attacked.12.0=*can't go wrong with a fourth shot*
energy_sphere_attacked.20=*Sticky fog and nothing else. You take your hand out and the feeling passes instantly.*
energy_sphere_attacked.22.2=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.11.3=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.22.1=Look, if this sphere is so passionate about our terminal, just turn it off. Maybe this thing will fly away?
energy_sphere_attacked.11.2=Look, if this sphere is so passionate about our terminal, just turn it off. Maybe this thing will fly away?
energy_sphere_attacked.22.0=*take out your gun and shoot the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.11.1=*touch the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.11.0=*shoot it once more*
energy_sphere_attacked.21.3=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.21.2=Look, if this sphere is so passionate about our terminal, just turn it off. Maybe this thing will fly away?
energy_sphere_attacked.10.3=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.21.1=And what do you say, personally?
energy_sphere_attacked.10.2=Look, if this sphere is so passionate about our terminal, just turn it off. Maybe this thing will fly away?
energy_sphere_attacked.21.0=*take out your gun and shoot the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.10.1=*touch the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.10.0=*shoot again*
energy_sphere_attacked.20.3=Yeah\u2026 We definitely need to find something out about this thing. But from who?
energy_sphere_attacked.20.2=Look, if this sphere is so passionate about our terminal, just turn it off. Maybe this thing will fly away?
energy_sphere_attacked.20.1=What do the dials inside this creature say?
energy_sphere_attacked.20.0=*take out your gun and shoot the sphere*
energy_sphere_attacked.19=*You feel some kind of sticky fog on your fingers, but this feeling passes quickly. Your hand doesn't even smell of anything.*
energy_sphere_attacked.18=*Everyone arounds you eyes you with caution and aloof wonderment. And they should! Their Captain just wasted seven shots, and now he's talking to himself. Okay. It's time to finish your joke.*
energy_sphere_attacked.17=*You're out of ammo. And don't even hope that you have some more.*
energy_sphere_attacked.16=*You're definitely taking the piss! The sphere isn't paying you any attention.*
energy_sphere_attacked.15=*There is a distinct smell of gunpowder in the lab. One of the scientists faints. One of the soldiers is laughing heartily. And you still won't leave it alone, will you? The sphere doesn't care, by the way. And it never will. You can shoot it with a grenade launcher and it won't care.* 
energy_sphere_attacked.14=*You're just taking the piss. The sphere doesn't care. It doesn't react to any physical stimuli! Your men are looking at you like at a complete idiot. And there are five holes in the floor. By the way, do you know how much these polymers cost?* 
energy_sphere_attacked.13=*Look, this is a lab, not a shooting gallery! The sphere doesn't react to your shots, stop ruining the floor! You're just making yourself look stupid.*
energy_sphere_attacked.12=*If the sphere could talk, it probably would have said something like \"What, again?\" The soldiers giggle politely. The look on the scientists' faces is... indescribable. There's a third hole in the floor. The sphere doesn't care, by the way.
energy_sphere_attacked.11=*The second bullet goes right through the center of the sphere. The scientists back up even more. The soldiers look at you curiously. The bullet is stuck in the floor again. The sphere doesn't care.*
energy_sphere_attacked.10=*The gun roars, the scientists jump back, the soldiers crouch. The bullet pierces soft polymer floor and gets stuck in the hard foundation. The sphere doesn't even flinch.*
energy_sphere_attacked.9=It's hard to say, Captain. *Gordon takes off his glasses and begins cleaning them with the sleeve of his coat.* This creature ignores all attempts to contact it. It's like we... don't exist, as far as it's concerned. *He walks up to the sphere and puts his hand in it. The sphere doesn't react in any way. Neither does his hand, obviously.* 
energy_sphere_attacked.8=*One of the scientists speaks up.* It reacts to standard behavioral tests like a living being! Of course, it's hard to say anything about its having conscience, but... *His voice peters out gradually, turning into excited mumbling.*
energy_sphere_attacked.7=*One of the soldiers answers.* We tried, Captain, it doesn't work. Although we didn't use anything too powerful, this is a lab, after all.
energy_sphere_attacked.6=*The white coats are silent. Gordon steps forward.* It's an alien. And it's\u2026 *He grabs his head.* It's here!
energy_sphere_attacked.5=*Gordon was right. It's not just an alien, it's a blue faintly glowing sphere about two meters in diameter. And it didn't \"attach\" itself to just any computer, it's the main computing terminal of the Aurora! Oh wow.*
energy_sphere_attacked.4=It won't come off! *Gordon looks wounded. Apparently, you'll have to go Research Deck after all.*
energy_sphere_attacked.3=It's\u2026 it's safe, Captain. It's not attacking anyone. The soldiers are there already, but nothing is happening. We need you to make a decision!
energy_sphere_attacked.2=Well, here\u2026 Something\u2026 *Gordon waves his hands around, his glasses glisten.* Attached itself to the computer! Something foreign, an alien!
energy_sphere_attacked.1=We\u2026 Uhhh\u2026 You have to see it. There. It's very important!
energy_sphere_attacked.0=*Someone is calling you from the science department. It's Gordon. The look on his face is a mixture of fear and childish happiness.* Captain! We... we need you.
