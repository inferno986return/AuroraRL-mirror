gordon_science_theories_physics.0.0=That was quick. What's in it?
gordon_science_theories_physics.3=Who needs logic when you have physics? *Gordon smiles.*
gordon_science_theories_physics.2=But they don't know whether dark matter consists of light supersymmetrical particles either!
gordon_science_theories_physics.2.0=I have a hard time grasping it all logically\u2026
gordon_science_theories_physics.1=Oh... *He wipes his glasses.* It's hard to say. Physics is a science about spherical cows, you know? It's complicated. We understood that the aliens have their own view on the supersymmetry of space in nature, which produces a logical for their experience mechanism of violating it, and of preventing high quantum corrections via supersymmetry on the electroweak scale... We can't understand that. I mean, we have the data... but arriving to that conclusion is very difficult.
gordon_science_theories_physics.0=Captain, we've studied the data you sent over already!
gordon_science_theories_physics.1.0=Uhhh\u2026
gordon_science_theories_physics.3.0=Right. Okay. I'm glad the data was useful to you. Over and out, Gordon.
