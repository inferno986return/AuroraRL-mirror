colony_default_2.9=I just told you. Are you deaf?
colony_default_2.8=We missed it! It ran into the research center, chewed through the computer and bit Susan Hong's leg. Susie fainted, can you imagine? Yeah, this place is something else. Right, then. Did you have any business, guys? Or maybe you wanted to help?
colony_default_2.7=We're doing okay here. You guys want to spend the night? We have a film screening and a banquet.
colony_default_2.6=Not much to tell. Can you upload some more books for us?
colony_default_2.6.0=Talk to someone else about that. We just came to check up on you.
colony_default_2.5=We had an acid rain an hour ago. It was purple. Very beautiful! Too bad you couldn't see it.
colony_default_2.4=We're doing okay, but someone died here. Two days ago, the day before yesterday.
colony_default_2.3=It's surprisingly quiet and calm. Even the last local animal raid was taken care of all right. So\u2026 it's all good.
colony_default_2.2=*He points to the window.* Look. Come on, take a look. What, are you surprised? Yeah! We have a cave-in, and half of our communication center dropped down there! But I don't think anything broke. We also clocked some alien ships in the atmosphere, but they were just watching, no funny business. Life goes on. We're okay.
colony_default_2.1=*He shrugs.* Can't you see? We're not doing great. A week ago some local rat chewed all the way through our main lab computer. We're lucky to have a replacement one! Otherwise, we're okay.
colony_default_2.0=I sincerely welcome our guests from Earth. I'm glad that you've come to visit us. Are you here on business? Maybe you want to help us?
colony_default_2.5.0=It rained acid?
colony_default_2.4.0=We're sorry. We really are.
colony_default_2.999=*Use your map to find the objects you need on the surface. All unusual objects, including the colonists and anomalies, are marked red.*
colony_default_2.3.0=That's great.
colony_default_2.33=Wonderful. *The colonist leader looks away and gives a few orders into his comm unit.* Our strongest scientists will go pick them up now. And we'll upload the new data to you right away, let Gordon have a look at it when he has the time.
colony_default_2.2.0=How did you contact us if your comms center fell underground? And it didn't, actually. There it is.
colony_default_2.32=*The colonist leader grabs his face and sighs.* God damn this planet. It's okay, we'll teach it a lesson later. Thanks for the help.
colony_default_2.31=Our small settlement takes another hit. It's a good thing that at least someone made it.
colony_default_2.30=Those are some great news. Too bad we have nothing to pay you with.
colony_default_2.0.9=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.0.8=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.0.7=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.0.6=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.1.0=How did it manage to do that?
colony_default_2.0.5=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.0.4=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.0.3=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.0.2=We've hunted the animals.
colony_default_2.0.1=We've found the lost group.
colony_default_2.0.0=We've found all the speleologists.
colony_default_2.29=How are they?
colony_default_2.28=*The colonist leader grabs his face and sighs.* God damn this planet. It's okay, we'll teach it a lesson later. Thanks for the help. We'll give you some resources for your trouble.
colony_default_2.27=How are they?
colony_default_2.26=Animals. There are some... let's call them wolves to make it easier for you. They're smarter than the wolves on Earth, but they're still dumb. You can tell they're smart because their attacks are coordinated, skillful, and they use several waves. You can tell they're dumb... *He sighs.* Because they jump us almost every week, we fight them back every time, and they still won't give it a rest! Are they dumb or what? Anyway. Help us repel the attack. You can take all the biomass with you for research. I know how much they love asking you for scientific data on Earth. You could use it.
colony_default_2.25=It's damn simple, guys. You go to the woods and find the animals we need. Using your guns, scientifically speaking, you transform the animals from live specimens to research material. You take that material to us. And then we hand you the findings of the research and biomass samples, since that is the kind of data they want from you back on Earth.
colony_default_2.24=Yeah. Our field guys were supposed to report in about seven hours ago. We can find them ourselves, we have the experience, but I'd be glad to accept your help. The animals are pretty fierce in these woods, and look at the armor and weapons you've got! If you save the scientists, you'll get the scientific data you need. I know exactly what they want from you back on Earth, huh?
colony_default_2.23=Of course. It's your call.
colony_default_2.22=A group of researchers, speleologists, has gone missing in one of the local caves. Again, we can find them ourselves, but help is always welcome, right? I don't want to risk my men. And if you save the scientists, you'll get valuable scientific data.
colony_default_2.21=*The colonist leader's meaty lips stretch into a smile.* The place we live in, we always need help. If you want, you could help us find some missing people, in the forest or in a cave. But we can do that ourselves, that's pretty easy. We'd rather you hunt some animals. Or helped us repel an attack.
colony_default_2.20=Too bad, but you can't go against your orders. In that case\u2026 why have you come here? You want to help us out a bit?
colony_default_2.0.11=No, our orders are to make sure you're alive and leave right away. We can't help you.
colony_default_2.0.10=If you need help, we could stay for a bit.
colony_default_2.999.0=Got it.
colony_default_2.19=Another six months on this planet! A great occasion, isn't it? So, are you staying?
colony_default_2.18=That's great. So, why have you come here? Do you want to help us out?
colony_default_2.17=Young man, even in times like these there are people who love to read!
colony_default_2.16=Yeah, yeah\u2026 It sucks! There's no fiction to read!
colony_default_2.15=No, just unusually acidic water. It won't make you burn, but it'll definitely give you a rash. Otherwise, we're all good. I don't even have anything to tell you... Did you have anything else? Or maybe you wanted to help?
colony_default_2.14=Did you have any more business? Or did you want to help out?
colony_default_2.13=Professor Cusie was a good man. But he shouldn't have strayed from the rest of the group. You know, guys, we wanted to send his body to Earth at first. But we only managed to find his hand and a part of his collarbone. So we decided to bury Cusie here. He's the only client of our only cemetery now. *He shakes his head.* God damn it.
colony_default_2.12=Definitely. Did you want to ask something else or did you come here to offer some help?
colony_default_2.11=Tell me about it\u2026 Right. Anything else? Maybe you want to help?
colony_default_2.10=Well\u2026 *He blushes.* It didn't fall through. It just sagged a lot. But still, that's a lot of extra work! Now we have to find out why it happened. And in the worst case scenario, we'll have to move the colony.
colony_default_2.19.0=We can't. We have orders.
colony_default_2.29.2=They were attacked by the local monsters. We couldn't save them. We barely got away ourselves.
colony_default_2.29.1=They were attacked by the local monsters. We managed to save some people, the rest died.
colony_default_2.18.2=No, our orders are to make sure you're alive and leave right away. We can't help you.

colony_default_2.18.0=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.28.0=You're welcome. Too bad we couldn't get there sooner.
colony_default_2.17.0=Okay, we'll tell the Captain.
colony_default_2.27.0=Unfortunately, they're all dead. There are some really scary beasts down in that cave, we barely managed to fight back ourselves. You really shouldn't go there without some very reliable guards.
colony_default_2.16.0=Don't you have a great supply of movies and video games?
colony_default_2.26.1=Damn. Shooting as many beasts as your heart desires, isn't that wonderful? But maybe you could use some help with something else?
colony_default_2.15.2=No, our orders are to make sure you're alive and leave right away. We can't help you.
colony_default_2.26.0=We can't promise you that we'll be here every week, but we'll help you today.
colony_default_2.15.1=If you need help, we could stay for a bit.
colony_default_2.15.0=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.25.1=It's tempting, but\u2026 Maybe you need help with something else?
colony_default_2.14.2=No, our orders are to make sure you're alive and leave right away. We can't help you.
colony_default_2.25.0=We're always glad to do some shooting. Where do we go?
colony_default_2.14.1=If you need help, we could stay for a bit.
colony_default_2.14.0=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.24.1=Maybe there's something else? Screwing around in the woods isn't really our thing.
colony_default_2.24.0=You're right. We do need the data, and we do have decent weapons. Show us the way.
colony_default_2.13.0=Uhhhh\u2026 Yeah. God damn it.
colony_default_2.23.4=We can't help you with anything today, our orders won't let us. We have to go.
colony_default_2.23.3=Who's going to attack you, then?
colony_default_2.23.2=Tell me more about hunting animals.
colony_default_2.23.1=People have gone missing in the forest?
colony_default_2.12.2=No, our orders are to make sure you're alive and leave right away. We can't help you.

colony_default_2.12.0=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.33.0=Don't forget to send us the data you recieve, we still have to report about the time we've wasted to Earth.
colony_default_2.22.1=Find them yourselves, then. Maybe we could help you with something else?
colony_default_2.11.2=No, our orders are to make sure you're alive and leave right away. We can't help you.
colony_default_2.22.0=It's better to risk someone else's men, right? Okay. We'll help you.
colony_default_2.11.1=If you need help, we could stay for a bit.
colony_default_2.11.0=The Captain told us to check how you're doing.
colony_default_2.21.4=We can't help you with anything today, our orders won't let us. We have to go.
colony_default_2.21.3=Who's going to attack you, then?
colony_default_2.21.2=Tell me more about hunting animals.
colony_default_2.32.0=You're welcome. Too bad we couldn't get there sooner.
colony_default_2.21.1=People have gone missing in the forest?
colony_default_2.21.0=Missing people? What's with that cave?
colony_default_2.10.0=Wow. That's unpleasant.
colony_default_2.20.2=No, our orders are to make sure you're alive and leave right away. We can't help you.
