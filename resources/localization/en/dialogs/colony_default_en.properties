colony_default.3.1=Of course. We'll get going. Good luck. 
colony_default.0=Right. They told me someone was coming over from the Aurora 2. 
colony_default.3.0=Why is that?
colony_default.4.0=Of course. We'll get going. Good luck. 
colony_default.0.0=How are things here?
colony_default.4=*The leader smirks.* Happened the day before yesterday. He was pickling, and then some monster jumps out of the woods at him. So Chest... He picks up a gun, right? Nope! He grabs the bucket full of acid and charges the bastard. Hahaha! Now there's a shortage of acid, he has to work very carefully, and Chest became a bit jumpy. 
colony_default.2.0=No, I can't. It's forbidden. 
colony_default.3=Oh. In that case, I'm not keeping you. You can take a walk around, see how it is. Just don't come close to the woods, and... *He thinks for a moment.* And you know... there's a guy there, he pickles pins. Well, don't distract him, he's a bit too jumpy. 
colony_default.2=*The leader shakes his head and smiles, wiping the sweat off of his forehead with his sleeve.* It's a vacation. The only thing is, you should always have a gun on you. Like, always. Apart from that... it's nice. Liveable. We're setting up here. You want to give us a hand?
