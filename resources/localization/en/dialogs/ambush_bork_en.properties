ambush_bork.8=*What happened to the idiot you just saw in front of you? The Bork shut his mouth and stopped covering his camera in spittle.

Someone is training their sights on the Aurora 2.*

My! *At least there are no translation problems. Either the Bork is that dumb or that nervous. He speaks in pronouns.* Help! My family! Bad ones, took, said collect credits! Many many credits! I thought! Wanted loan, no one gave! Friend said, \"Arrrgh, you're stupid. Why don't you ask the human captain for help while you're at it?\" Good friend! Good advice! I fly here! Wait! You here! Help!
