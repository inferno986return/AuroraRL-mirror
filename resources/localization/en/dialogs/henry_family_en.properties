henry_family.4.1=Too bad, but I have to leave you be now. Over and out. 
henry_family.4.0=Let's talk about something else.
henry_family.0.0=Why not?
henry_family.1.1=Captain Shepherd?
henry_family.1.0=I think it's unpleasant for you. I'm sorry I brought it up. 
henry_family.4=It's okay. It's not unpleasant. They're happy, so am I. And it's too early to change anything, anyway. 
henry_family.3=*Henry smirks.* It's not too hard to remember it, considering that we have all the movies in our home cinema. So we watched them with my kids. *He sighs.* Now it seems a bit ironic. 
henry_family.2=Yeah, Captain Shepherd. Those movies about the spacecraft captain, there's also a bunch of aliens serving with him. I don't remember the plot, something about saving the Earth.
henry_family.1=I spent all my life in the military, in special forces. I mean... *Henry shrugs.* I think it was the wrong thing to do. I haven't had a real conversation with my children for a very long time. I remember my leave a year and a half ago. We'd watch Captain Shepherd with them a lot.
henry_family.0=*Henry thinks for a few secons.* Actually\u2026 *He speaks slowly, drawlingly, musingly.* We aren't very close, Captain. 
henry_family.2.0=I think I remember something like that.
henry_family.3.0=I think it's unpleasant for you. I'm sorry I brought it up.
