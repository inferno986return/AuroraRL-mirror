klisk_trade_probe_earth.0.0=I don't even know what to say.
klisk_trade_probe_earth.5.0=That's not news. Or great.
klisk_trade_probe_earth.1.1=I don't, unfortunately.
klisk_trade_probe_earth.1.0=Yes. I had a feeling it wasn't going to end well.
klisk_trade_probe_earth.7=As usual, you have the carte blanche. If you have to, you can destroy the object, but I don't think its owners will like it too much. So try to deal with it peacefully.
klisk_trade_probe_earth.6=Of course. I'll say it right now: hurry up! I'm not going to tell you it's terribly important, but this ruckus really gets in the way.
klisk_trade_probe_earth.6.0=My authorizations?
klisk_trade_probe_earth.5=In that case, I have great news: you need to find it out and do something about that thing.
klisk_trade_probe_earth.4=What do you think? We need to deal with this.
klisk_trade_probe_earth.3=In that case, I'll go out on a limb and say it's jamming our comms with ads. It would have been funny if it wasn't so sad.
klisk_trade_probe_earth.2.0=It's going to make you laugh, but it's a Klisk trading bot.
klisk_trade_probe_earth.2=And what is it?
klisk_trade_probe_earth.7.0=Well, I'll try. Is that all? Then I have to go.
klisk_trade_probe_earth.1=Of course you don't. *Martan turns off the devices.* It's been like that for a week. Every two hours. Everywhere on the planet, on everything that even remotely resembles a speaker. The source, as we've found out, is on the orbit, and it's something alien. Do you know anything about this?
klisk_trade_probe_earth.0=Wait a minute. *Martan puts two cell phones and a radio down on the table. After a couple of minutes, every device starts ringing, and the radio starts blinking its light. Martan turns them on, you can hear unclear speech set to a tune out of their speakers. You can make out the words \"buy\" and \"discount.\" Apparently, it's in Klisk.* What do you think?
klisk_trade_probe_earth.3.0=What, nothing helps?
klisk_trade_probe_earth.4.0=And I'll be the one \"dealing\" with it, I suppose.
