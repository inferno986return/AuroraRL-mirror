unity_station_inside.7.0=Bereshit? \"In the beginning.\" It's Hebrew.
unity_station_inside.6.0=*look around*
unity_station_inside.19.0=Excuse me for bothering you, but when does the session start?
unity_station_inside.29.0=Curious. When does the session start?
unity_station_inside.5.0=[CONTINUE]
unity_station_inside.18.0=Excuse me for bothering you, but when does the session start?
unity_station_inside.4.2=No, I was just asking. Let's go on. I want to get there as soon as I can.
unity_station_inside.4.1=Of course. Go on without me, I want to take a look around.
unity_station_inside.28.0=Finally.
unity_station_inside.4.0=What other wings are there at the station?
unity_station_inside.29=Me? Neither. You don't have to believe in science, human captain. You have to do science.
unity_station_inside.17.0=[CONTINUE]
unity_station_inside.28=*For some time, Joseph, the Ambassador and the major discuss religion. Nothing too deep: the Ambassador, despite his interest, doesn't understand much about Christianity yet, Joseph's knowledge isn't too extensive, and the major simply doesn't care. In the end, they're interrupted by the screen: it turns on. Nothing is on it so far, but the aliens begin to take their seats quickly. Apparently, the session has started.*
unity_station_inside.27=*The major answers politely.* The Bork religion is... special. We aren't poly- or monotheistic. I would say Borks believe in superstition. At least those who aren't smart enough to believe in science.
unity_station_inside.26=*The Ambassador's smile becomes a little crooked. He's embarrassed.* I'm not as knowledgeable about your religions as I would like yet... But I hope it's just a matter of time, especially here at Unity.
unity_station_inside.25=*The Ambassador nods.* I tried reading the religious book we're talking about... The Bible, was it? But without proper interpretations there's not much you can understand, as you may suspect.
unity_station_inside.3.1=*walk on in silence to get to the session earlier*
unity_station_inside.27.0=What do you believe in, Major?
unity_station_inside.24=*Joseph is happy you returned. You can feel it.* Oh, Captain! No, of course not, I had no time to. I was telling Mr Firshe about the peculiarities of the Book of Genesis, he's very interested in it. *The Rogue ambassador nods and, still smiling politely, asks.* So, how did you say? Bereshit? A word from the language of a people you call Jews, meaning \"in the beginning\"? Interesting... I find your religion very interesting, gentlemen.
unity_station_inside.16.1=No. Excuse me.
unity_station_inside.3.0=It's nice. Can I take a look around?
unity_station_inside.23=*And the words freeze on your lips. You're looking at a sentient creature that is absolutely certain it's right. Talking to it any more would be silly. You walk away.*
unity_station_inside.16.0=No, that's not why I'm here. However\u2026 you were saying something. Finish it.
unity_station_inside.22=*The major answers.* The session? Any minute n- *He is inturrupted by the screen, which turns on. Nothing is on it so far, but the aliens begin to take their seats quickly. Apparently, the session has started.*
unity_station_inside.15.5=I should go. The session won't wait for me.
unity_station_inside.21=*The hall inside is small. You could even call it compact. There is no one at the round table that's right in front of a gigantic screen, even though everybody seems to be there. The aliens have gathered in the room, talking to each other in an informal setting so far. You can see Joseph, still by Major Okrarr's side, talking to him about something. The Rogue ambassador is next to them, mainly nodding and smiling. The Bork ambassador is talking to his underlings, also Borks. The Zorsan representative is with his own, too. Only the Klisk ambassador cruises around, managing to talk to everybody at once.*
unity_station_inside.15.4=*exits from the hall*
unity_station_inside.20=*There are emotions in the guard's face obvious even to a non-Zorsan. Finally, he goes for ut.* After what you've done?! You attacked our diplomatic representative!! Neglected our warm welcome!! Started a war!! You... you really a twisted parody of a normal being!
unity_station_inside.2.2=*walk on in silence to get to the session earlier*
unity_station_inside.15.3=*lower floors*

unity_station_inside.24.2=Major, what do the Borks believe in?
unity_station_inside.13.3=*transparent ceiling*
unity_station_inside.24.1=Are you only interested in Christianity?
unity_station_inside.0.1=Lead the way.
unity_station_inside.13.2=*lower floors*
unity_station_inside.24.0=You're talking about Genesis? The interesting part is ahead.
unity_station_inside.0.0=Who are you? Take us where?

unity_station_inside.19=*Joseph briefly explains where exactly the ambassador is wrong. It's an easy question.* You ask unusual questions, Mr Firshe. You have a hard time understand what we're talking about because your God, if I could call it that, is the Devourer, also known as the Obliterator. A wholly different category, Mr Ambassador, wholly different.
unity_station_inside.11.5=I should go. The session won't wait for me.
unity_station_inside.18=*Joseph nods again, he's pleased.* I couldn't give a better answer myself. Still, you ask unusual questions, Mr Firshe. You have a hard time understand what we're talking about because your God, if I could call it that, is the Devourer, also known as the Obliterator. A wholly different category, Mr Ambassador, wholly different.
unity_station_inside.11.4=*exits from the hall*
unity_station_inside.17=*Khryh Okrarr wasn't wrong: the nearest employee (a Rogue with a bunch of phosphorescent cables jutting out of his head and going to somewhere around his lower back) calmly walks you to where the session is going to take place. This hall is in a wing that doesn't belong to any of the embassies. Stopping in front of the door, the Rogue nods and walks away. The only thing left to do is to go in.*
unity_station_inside.11.3=*transparent ceiling*
unity_station_inside.16=*You can't go through most of them: they're personnel only. Others are for the ambassadors. Lost in thought, you don't notice how you end up next to the Zorsan Embassy entrance. The security guards begins talking right away.* It's you! And you... *He cuts himself off with a visible exercise of willpower.* Ahem, you... would you like to visit the Zorsan Empire Embassy?
unity_station_inside.11.2=*lower floors*
unity_station_inside.22.0=Finally.
unity_station_inside.15=*Whatever this ceiling is made from, it does its job well. The view is simply... breathtaking. The star of this system (you wonder if they call it a sun) looks like you could reach it with your hand. Its muted glow becomes gentle, it doesn't hurt your eyes. A multitude of vortices of deadly heat look like they're competing in quickness and strength. You can see small flashes. This view reminds you of the dying Sun of Earth.*
unity_station_inside.11.1=*upper floors*
unity_station_inside.14=Excuse me, Captain, the lower floors of Unity are maintenance and security personnel only. *The Bork smiles politely. Yeah, they're good at it. How can you argue with a creature who has a smile like that?*
unity_station_inside.11.0=*monument*
unity_station_inside.13=*Getting up on the top floors only takes a couple of minutes, since the elevators here are very fast. But there's nothing of note up here. Just a lot of offices. You have no reason to walk into any of them. A little disappointed, you come back down.*
unity_station_inside.12=*You walk up to the monument. There are local equivalents to benches installed around it: you can sit down and relax. Up close, you can see that it's not actually glass: the five long transparent beams meeting towards the middle and rising up to the ceiling bunched are made of some kind of mineral. You can see some pieces in it, crumbs, and even small insects. Also, this mineral gives off a faint glow.*
unity_station_inside.11=*Mostly you can see Rogues and Borks. It's logical: operating personnel and security staff. However, there's a lot of other aliens too: Klisks floating around on their platforms lazily, and even Zorsan! A group of strongly built specimens in black robes has an unpleasant reaction to your look - did they recognize you? - and leaves through one of the hallways, conversing with each other snappily.
unity_station_inside.10=*Joseph talks about the beginning of Genesis at some length.* What is it that you didn't understand? *The Rogue ambassador smiles and answers.* \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\" If there was God, what kind of beginning is that? The beginning should be the moment God appeared, don't you think?
unity_station_inside.21.0=Miss me, Joseph?
unity_station_inside.10.1=*let Joseph answer*
unity_station_inside.10.0=There is some logic to that. However, we are talking about different categories. According to the canons of this religion, God doesn't belong to the category of things that are created or come into being. He just is. At least that's what followers of Christianity believe.
unity_station_inside.20.0=Listen\u2026
unity_station_inside.9=The captain's answer is correct. *Joseph nods.* That's how the Book of Genesis begins. What is it that you didn't understand? *The Rogue ambassador smiles and answers.* \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\" If there was God, what kind of beginning is that? The beginning should be the moment God appeared, don't you think?
unity_station_inside.8=*A big, very big hall of several floors. If you look up, you can see faces looking downwards with curiosity. Aliens are bustling everywhere, going up and down in the elevators. In the center, there is a monument made from glass (you think), reaching the transparent ceiling through which you can see the star of the local system. Several doors lead away from the hall.*
unity_station_inside.7=*The hall inside is small. You could even call it compact. There is no one at the round table that's right in front of a gigantic screen, even though everybody seems to be there. The aliens have gathered in the room, talking to each other in an informal setting so far. Despite being a bit out of his element, Joseph quickly blends into the conversation: he's talking to the Rogue ambassador about religion, which the latter is very interested in. The rest of the aliens aren't as chatty. The Zorsan ambassador is standing aside, looking like a cultist in his black robe. The Bork ambassador is talking to one of his compatriots. You are jerked out of peaceful contemplation by a question from the Rogye ambassador.* I tried reading it, but I didn't understand much. For example, \"bereshit.\" What is that?
unity_station_inside.6=*Khryh nods. Joseph and he leave quickly. You're left alone.*
unity_station_inside.5=*The major takes you to a wing that doesn't belong to any of the embassies. It looks like the decoration isn't finished on it, it's so new. Otherwise it's not any different from the rest of the facilities. You three walk fast, so in just a couple of minutes you're facing the door you need. The major enters first.*
unity_station_inside.4=*The Bork stops and thinks.* I suppose. You have some time left... about two hours, I think... that's what you call those periods of time, right? If you want, you could stay and explore the station. Talk to any station employee, he'll take you to the diplomatic wing. *Joseph looks a little offended. Looks like he's uncomfortable with being on his own and surrounded by aliens.*
unity_station_inside.3=Aside from the diplomatic wing there are only service wings: residential ones for the personnel, maintenance, military... Basically, Unity was created as a place where people could meet and discuss the politics of any of the peoples, without fearing for themselves.
unity_station_inside.2=*The Bork takes you to the special entrance for diplomatic workers. Coming through it, you find yourself in a big hall with a glass ceiling. You can see glow of this system's star through it.* This is the center of the station, gentlemen. *The Bork talks as he walks.* Any part of the station is most easily reached from here. We are going into the diplomatic wing, and entry there is, of course, limited.
unity_station_inside.1=Major Khryh Okrarr. *The Bork nods and bares his teeth.* A session you need to attend is starting soon. You don't want to through the security checkpoint with everybody, do you? *Khryh meaningfully points with his paw to a long line of aliens standing in front of the security facility. Probably something like customs.*
unity_station_inside.0=*Even though you haven't been at alien space stations for a long time, it's still obvious: Unity doesn't look like any of them. Even the interior design, the drawing on the walls, the colors they chose, the glow of the lamps... everything looks harmonious, and not only to the humans: the crowds of aliens around don't mind the design either. It's noisy. Busy, even.* Captain! *Joseph is a little nervous.* Looks like that Bork is walking towards us. *He's right: the Bork, wearing the uniform of the personnel of this station, approaches you and salutes.* Human captain. Mr Ambassador. I have orders to take you to your destination. Allow me.
unity_station_inside.9.1=*let Joseph answer*
unity_station_inside.8.6=I should go. The session won't wait for me.
unity_station_inside.9.0=There is some logic to that. However, we are talking about different categories. According to the canons of this religion, God doesn't belong to the category of things that are created or come into being. He just is. At least that's what followers of Christianity believe.
