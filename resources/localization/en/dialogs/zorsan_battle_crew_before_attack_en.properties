zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.19=I found about it on Earth. Or rather, from Earth. It's a big project, everyone keeps talking about it. *Sarah says all of it without pausing for breath or looking away.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.18=*She blushes and looks to the side, then adds.* But we shouldn't throw ourselves into the thick of it. We're not the Voyager.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.17=If it was possible to get the most out of the equipment without harming it or losing firepower, I did it. I give you my word: *she really stresses that last part* our girl won't let you down.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.16=You're talking like some\u2026 ew. Okay. I didn't want to offend you, just\u2026 *She blushes again.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.15=And I just gave you an answer. *She shrugs and smiles.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.14=It's just your opinion. It's blunt, but true.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.13=No\u2026 *She blushes and shakes her head.* Yes! Even if it's true, you say it like it's a bad thing.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.12=Oh, it's\u2026 *She waves her hand dismissively, closes the book and puts it aside.* It's religious, one of my dad's books. I don't think you'll get it.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.11=*Sarah is reading a book. You can't see the cover. When she gets the call, she looks at the camera and smiles.* Yo, Cap.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.49.0=Today, I have that dream. It will always be with me, no matter what happens. It is a dream about a moment where all of us - the humans, the Klisks, the Borks, and even the Zorsan - where we all live together, and even if we don't love each other, at least we respect each other. I think that'll be the best outcome.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.10=I'm a different case. You could say that war is my real mother. I didn't have to get used to it. Doesn't matter. In any case, don't worry. We're cogs in a machine. Everything that's supposed to spin is spinning, and everything that's supposed to run is running. This is the best thing we can expect.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.8.0=How can I not think about it? There's so much responsibility.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.47.0=And because of that, I'm confident. I'm confident of you and of myself. Of everyone who is on our side of the barricades today. We will win. And I order you to share my confidence.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.6.0=Can the Aurora 2 handle a long fight?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.45.0=You know, I've never considered violence a way to solve difficult situations. You've seen the Universe, it's complex and beautiful. Yes, it's full of death. But there's a lot of life in it, too. It's too bad that we have to go to war, but know this: we're fighting for the continuation of life.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.4.2=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.4.1=There's going to be a battle\u2026 I don't know what to think.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.4.0=Report on the status of the weapon systems and the crew.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.43.0=It's hard to say what expects us. It really is. War is kind to no one. Not even us, despite the fact that we're its children. But we don't have a choice. The Universe is huge, but there's no place we can retreat to: the Earth is behind us!
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.2.2=You need a clear head and complete control in battle.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.2.1=\"Little\" is the operating word here, right?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.2.0=No. I'd have one myself, to be honest.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.41.2=All right, that's all for now. I was checking the comms. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.41.1=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.28.2=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.41.0=What happened here? What is\u2026 all that?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.0.4=This is no time to get emotional. I have to keep on my guard.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.99.4=This is no time to get emotional. I have to keep on my guard.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.28.1=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.0.3=*turn on the PA system and talk to the entire crew*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.99.3=*turn on the PA system and talk to the entire crew*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.28.0=What are you reading?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.0.2=*call Gordon*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.99.2=*call Gordon*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.0.1=*call Sarah*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.99.1=*call Sarah*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.0.0=*call Henry*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.99.0=*call Henry*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.26.0=Yeah. And if I believed in Him, I'd doubt myself even more. I think faith isn't as much a sign of your being chosen as a much bigger responsibility. In a way, I have it easier than you.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.24.0=You're talking as if death was the only thing Man had. But he also has life. And that's the most thing. It's what makes us human.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.101.0=Woe is me\u2026
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.22.1=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.22.0=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.20.2=No.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.20.1=I don't know.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.20.0=Yes.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.38.2=All right, that's all for now. I was checking the comms. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.38.1=There's going to be a battle. Are you nervous?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.38.0=What happened here? What is\u2026 all that?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.36.2=All right, that's all for now. I was checking the comms. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.36.1=There's going to be a battle. Are you nervous?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.36.0=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.34.2=I understand your opinion and I respect it, but\u2026 There's nothing we can do. Maybe when all this is over we'll work together with the Zorsan.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.34.1=Gordon, it's no time for thoughts like those. I'm not accusing you of anything, but you're setting an example. What do your people see now?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.99=*Space is endless and silent. You still have time.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.34.0=Are you talking about your experiment? The third phase? If it was stopped, there was a reason.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.98=Oh, Cap, wait! *She smiles slyly.* It's been a long time\u2026 you promised me a dinner. Captain's ration. *She licks her upper lip playfully, her eyes shine.* I think it's the perfect time to remind you.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.19.2=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.32.0=Why?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.19.1=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.19.0=There's going to be a battle. What do you think?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.30.3=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.30.2=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.30.1=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.30.0=What are you reading?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.17.0=Great. Good job.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.15.1=There's going to be a battle. What do you think?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.15.0=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.9=Well, relax then, Captain. War\u2026 *Henry smiles, but he doesn't look very happy.* The thing about it is, you get used to it. And you'll get used to it, too. If we make it.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.13.2=No, of course not. If that's what your sould needs, why not? I approve your choice.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.8=Don't think about it.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.13.1=There's nothing wrong about that. I just asked you a question.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.7=I wouldn't know, you better ask Frontz, Captain\u2026 But I think it can. But we better not jump into the thick of it.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.13.0=There is no place for God on a space ship. Even if He exists, He stayed in the skies. We're above Him.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.6=The crew is doing good, they're nervous but ready for action. The weapon systems are okay, we're giving them maximum power.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.5=*Henry finishes his drink and puts his glass on the table.* This is it, don't worry. Is there anything else?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.101=I won't let you forget this!
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.4=I can see we have some things in common. *He finishes his drink and puts his glass on the table.**
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.11.4=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.3=*Henry smiles.* Good brandy is included in the Captain's ration. The important thing is not to overdo it. *He finishes his drink and puts the glass on the table.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.11.3=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.2=What else can I do? Maybe I\u2026 ahem\u2026 I don't want to sound subversive. I just decided to have a little drink. Is that a bad thing, Captain?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.11.2=There's going to be a battle. What do you think?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.1=*Henry is reclining in his chair and sipping something from a glass. It looks like alcohol.* Oh, Captain\u2026 Hello.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.11.1=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.0=*The battle awaits you. Who knows how it will end... Are you nervous? Are you scared? It doesn't matter. In moments like this, during quiet moments of complete calm, everything goes to the background. You get an opportunity to do some things before it's too late.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.11.0=What are you reading?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.9.1=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.9.0=Did it take you long to get used to it?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.48.0=And I still haven't said the most important thing: we'll be fighting for their peace, too. Those who will come at us with weapons drawn today. Someone said that it wasn't hate that hurt, it was indifference. In a sense, it's true.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.7.2=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.7.1=There's going to be a battle\u2026 I don't know what to think.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.7.0=I can see you're relaxing.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.46.2=I have a dream. I dream about many things. I dream about the entire Universe. A Universe populated by various creatures. Creatures that can call each other their equals.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.46.1=It's very simple. We're fighting for peace. No, not the Pax Humana, but our peace. Peace as our future, as the future of our children.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.46.0=The conditions are new to us, and we aren't used to such battles. But don't be afraid. It's just a good old war. And war never changes.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.5.2=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.5.1=There's going to be a battle\u2026 I don't know what to think.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.5.0=Report on the status of the weapon systems and the crew.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.44.0=A hard battle expects us. I'm not going to lie to you, it won't be easy. But am I afraid of defeat? No. Our enemies don't have the truth that we have.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.3.2=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.3.1=There's going to be a battle\u2026 I don't know what to think.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.3.0=I'll keep that in mind. Report on the status of the weapon systems and the crew.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.42.2=This is the captain speaking\u2026 Something very difficult awaits us. I won't have another moment to talk to you. So I won't keep silent any more.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.29.3=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.42.1=Hello to all of you. I would like to say a few words.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.29.2=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.42.0=Crew. This is your captain speaking. We are faced with a difficult test. Anyway. I would like to address you.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.29.1=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.1.3=Nevermind. I was checking the comms. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.29.0=What are you reading?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.1.2=There's going to be a battle\u2026 I don't know what to think.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.1.1=Report on the status of the weapon systems and the crew.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.1.0=Yeah, Liszkiewicz. I can see you're relaxing.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.27.2=I do it based on my religious beliefs. It's good when you have something to believe in.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.40.0=Well, death, for one. I think that's a good reason.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.27.1=That's a hard question. I don't know how to answer it. It all depends on the situation.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.27.0=I do what my mind tells me. Not because I'm disrespectful, no. It's just the world we live in.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.98.0=Oh, damn it. I've forgotten about it. I think the calm before the storm isn't the best time for that. We'll see afterwards.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.25.3=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.25.2=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.25.1=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.25.0=What are you reading?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.23.2=Yeah, I do.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.23.1=Hard to say.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.23.0=Um\u2026 That's a strange question. No, I'm an atheist.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.21.1=If it's so personal, maybe you shouldn't.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.21.0=Of course.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.50=*You finish your speech and turn off the PA system. Are you content with what you just said? And much more importantly, are they?*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.49=*Was it a good idea to talk about peace when facing mortal danger? We'll see. Now, it's time to wrap it up. Everything is good in moderation.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.48=*Is it right, to talk about future with those who may not have it? It doesn't matter. Time to wrap it up. Everything is good in moderation.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.47=*If you wanted to boost your people's morale, you've done it. It's time to wrap it up. Everything is good in moderation.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.46=*You wonder how your crew reacted to that. Doesn't matter. Go on.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.45=*You can hear your own voice from the other side of your quarters door, faintly. It sounds quiet yet firm.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.44=*You can hear your own voice from the other side of your quarters door, faintly. Maybe that's why it sounds so neutral.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.43=*You can hear your own voice from the other side of your quarters door, faintly. Despite this, it sounds\u2026 spirited.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.42=*A low hum fills the air instantly. Your entire ship can hear you, from the navigator's quarters to the machine deck. You need to say something. You can't just disconnect now.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.41=Death? Oh\u2026 That's right. *Gordon looks calm and stays silent, waiting for your orders.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.40=What do you mean? What\u2026 *He stutters and blushes.* What am I supposed to be worried about?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.39.0=You're saying all this as if it didn't worry you at all.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.37.2=All right, that's all for now. I was checking the comms. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.50.0=\u2026
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.37.1=There's going to be a battle. Are you nervous?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.37.0=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.39=Not really. *He shakes his head and speaks surprisingly calmly, with a voice that is completely different from his usual one.* The Science department is well-shielded from a stray hit. And if something does manage to get to us... *He shrugs.* We'll all get some.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.35.2=All right, that's all for now. I was checking the comms. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.38=It's all right. Science department is in power-saving mode. Everything for the war effort, right?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.35.1=There's going to be a battle. Are you nervous?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.37=We will\u2026 Phase three... *Gordon is looking away from the camera. He looks musing. Because of the weak light from the candles, it looks like his eyes are behind some kind of fog. Suddenly, he speaks.* Okay... Is there anything else, Captain?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.35.0=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.36=Yeah\u2026 *Gordon cleans his glasses nervously with his sleeve.* Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. But still\u2026 No. No. Thank you, Captain. Is there anything else?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.35=There was\u2026 *You can see incredible sadness in Gordon's eyes.* Captain\u2026 Oh, you won't understand. I don't want to talk about this.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.34=Yeah\u2026 but\u2026 *He waves his hands around.* They're different! And we're different! Peace is better! They're completely new... Maybe we and they, we could have... Could have repeated\u2026
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.33=*The candlelight is reflected in Gordon's glasses. He looks inspired.* It gives you a sense of... of something unusual. Something new... *He speaks excitedly.* Captain, maybe we shouldn't even go to war with the Zorsan?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.32=Oh\u2026 this\u2026 *He smiles.* Nothing. I like reading by candlelight.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.31=*You're surprised to see that Gordon is reading some book by candlelight.* What\u2026 ah! Captain!! *He adjusts his glasses.* Sorry. That was sudden. I didn't expect that.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.30=I could agree with you, but\u2026 *She winces.* Doesn't matter. Is there anything else?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.33.0=What do you mean, we shouldn't? They're attacking, we're defending. There's no choice.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.31.3=Nevermind. I was checking the comms. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.31.2=There's going to be a battle. Are you nervous?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.18.3=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.31.1=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.18.2=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.31.0=What happened here? What is\u2026 all that?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.18.1=There's going to be a battle. What do you think?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.18.0=How do you know about the Voyager?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.16.1=There's going to be a battle. What do you think?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.16.0=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.14.3=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.14.2=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.14.1=There's going to be a battle. What do you think?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.29=Your position is a bit too cautious, Captain. I mean, it's good, being in the middle is the best thing, but I think sometimes you need to have an opinion of your own.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.14.0=Give me a report on the systems you're in charge of.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.28=*It looks like Sarah's become a bit sad.* Yeah\u2026 That's the world we live in. Is there anything else, Cap?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.27=Oh\u2026 Captain\u2026 I wonder. When you need to make a choice, any choice\u2026 How do you do it? Do you make it according to your religious beliefs or something else?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.26=Why not? You're not confident in yourself? *Sarah's smile looks patronizing.*
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.25=*Sarah's smile becomes crooked.* There is some sense in what you're saying. I've never thought about it like that. Although\u2026 that's just your opinion.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.24=*Sarah looks at you with a slight, a little pitying smile.* How is it, Cap? You live for the first and only time, and then, boom! You're going into the black nothing.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.23=Do you believe in God?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.22=Oh\u2026 Okay then.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.12.0=You're trying to find solace in your faith?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.21=It's a stupid question, but\u2026 Captain\u2026 I wanted to ask you something. It's very personal.
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.20=What can I say? I'm afraid. Are you afraid?
zorsan_battle_crew_before_attack.10.0=All right, that's all for now. Over and out.
