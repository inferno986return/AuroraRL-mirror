rogues_altar_earth.7=The main thing is, don't promise them our souls and don't provoke a war. If you have to shoot, don't ruin the Moon's landscape with your ship's weapons..
rogues_altar_earth.0.0=No. What's up with it?
rogues_altar_earth.6=Their prayers are making the gravitational activity of the Moon jump around like a scared bunny. You know the city Shanwei in the Asian Union? Half of it is underwater. And if we don't do anything about it, pretty soon not only the second half of Shanwei will be there, but also lots of coastal cities all over the planet.
rogues_altar_earth.5=Praying to our Sun?
rogues_altar_earth.5.0=Yeah. They're just praying to our Sun. What's wrong with that?
rogues_altar_earth.4=Wow. And what can you tell me?
rogues_altar_earth.3=Reasonable. Aggression isn't off the table, but if it will lead to undesirable consequences, better not. Apart from that, if an armed conflict is inevitable, shooting at the Moon with the Aurora 2 weapons is forbidden. So if you can reach a peaceful solution, do it.
rogues_altar_earth.2=Not only the gravitational activity... Don't get caught up on unnecessary details. What really matters is that half of Shanwei got flooded because of it. And if those weirdos don't leave the Moon alone, a new hurricane will flood the rest of it. And then it'll go to work on Miami, Cuba...
rogues_altar_earth.1.0=It \"has changed\"?
rogues_altar_earth.1=That's the thing, it's pretty hard to understand what's going on there. Some aliens are setting up some kind of device there. Apparently, their intentions are peaceful. However, the gravitational activity on the Moon has changed. *Martan coughs into his fist and looks at the floor.*
rogues_altar_earth.6.0=Right. I understand my objective. What can am I permitted to do?
rogues_altar_earth.0=Things, things\u2026 *Martan turns on the tablet on his desk.* Things aren't going great. Have you heard about what's happening on the Moon?
rogues_altar_earth.2.0=I got it. Okay. I'll try to sort it out. What are my permissions?
rogues_altar_earth.7.0=Of course, Martan. I understand. Let's go back to the other things.
rogues_altar_earth.3.0=All right, Martan. I got it. Let's go back to the other things.
rogues_altar_earth.4.0=They're Rogues. They haven't taken any aggressive actions yet, their goals are pretty peaceful. From what I understood, they're setting up something like an advanced Altar and praying to our Sun.
rogues_altar_earth.0.1=Yes, when we entered the system, my Science Department recorded some strange activity there. We checked it out.
