metropole_burden_leader_family.19=Yeah, I hope so, too. Thank you, Captain.
metropole_burden_leader_family.18=That's actually for the best. We can finally settle down in one place. Jodie is going to find some friends, and... traveling to another planet is an exciting adventure for a child, isn't it? And as to myself, same for me... I'll get used to it. I said that already.
metropole_burden_leader_family.17=We had none. And that's a bad thing. *She nods and looks a bit sad.* I'm an adult, I can live with that. But what about Jodie, living with no real friends? However, even that has its upsides, as I can see now. I can't believe I'm saying these things right now.
metropole_burden_leader_family.16=He studies science, but his job is Executive Human Resources Manager. Nothing specific, just working with employees.
metropole_burden_leader_family.15=Not really. We've never stayed long in one place. *She shrugs.* My husband has worked for Aurora as long as we've been married, we kept moving from one place to another. So neither Jodie nor I miss anything much.
metropole_burden_leader_family.14=*Her eyes are wide open in shock, but she's still speaking quietly, apparently unwilling to disturb her daughter.* Captain, what are you saying? I know you're a hero, but you... you've got people here! How can you be so reckless?! *The woman shakes her head and crosses her arms over her chest.*
metropole_burden_leader_family.13=Phew! *She sighs with relief.* Such a load off my mind! After all, I have my daughter with me, and I haven't seen my husband in so long... it'd be very... not getting to see him in the end... Ahem. Sorry. *The woman rubs her eye with her fist.*
metropole_burden_leader_family.12=*She bites her lip lightly and nods.* Okay. Thank you for the warning.
metropole_burden_leader_family.11=*The woman's lips move and she fakes coughing the next moment to hide her smile.* I'm sorry, I... I don't know... dust. I get it. I've been meaning to ask you, Captain. *She leans in closer to the camera and almost whispers.* Is it true that the ship could get attacked?!
metropole_burden_leader_family.10=Not surprising at all, Captain. You're like my daughter, she adapted to life onboard easily, too... I'm trying to catch up with her. Anyway, I've been meaning to ask you, but... *The woman lowers her voice and speaks noticeably quieter.* They told me the ship could get attacked! Is that true?
metropole_burden_leader_family.19.3=Good talking to you. I hope you enjoy the flight. Enjoy your break, ma'am.
metropole_burden_leader_family.19.2=Your daughter really does play the guitar well. But the tune didn't sound like kid music to me.
metropole_burden_leader_family.19.1=How do you like the Aurora 2?
metropole_burden_leader_family.19.0=How's the flight going for you? Is everything all right?

metropole_burden_leader_family.11.2=Don't worry. There's nothing we can't fix. Even if we get attacked.
metropole_burden_leader_family.22.0=Right. I forgot to ask her name for some reason\u0415
metropole_burden_leader_family.11.1=Come on, those are just rumors. We're far away from the combat zone, it's all okay.
metropole_burden_leader_family.11.0=I'll be honest: it could.

metropole_burden_leader_family.8.2=I don't know if you'll understand, but I don't feel boxed in or oppressed by it. I've never felt more free.
metropole_burden_leader_family.8.1=I've never thought of it that way. You know, I guess I'm used to it. This ship is my home.
metropole_burden_leader_family.8.0=Yeah, all this metal with nothing but space beyond it is very unnerving sometimes, but what can you do?
metropole_burden_leader_family.7.3=Right. I hope you enjoy the flight. Enjoy your break, ma'am.
metropole_burden_leader_family.7.2=Your daughter really does play the guitar well. But the tune didn't sound like kid music to me.

metropole_burden_leader_family.5.0=How do you like the Aurora 2?
metropole_burden_leader_family.4.1=Actually, yes it is. First we need to deliver the ambassador from Earth to the Unity space station.
metropole_burden_leader_family.4.0=Not much longer now, ma'am. We've already been to the Unity, so\u0415 we're going to the colony.
metropole_burden_leader_family.3.4=Right. I hope you enjoy the flight. Enjoy your break, ma'am.
metropole_burden_leader_family.3.3=Your daughter really does play the guitar well. But the tune didn't sound like kid music to me.

metropole_burden_leader_family.3.0=How's the flight going for you? Is everything all right?
metropole_burden_leader_family.2.0=It's all right. She's a really cute kid. And she's even a decent guitar player, too.
metropole_burden_leader_family.1.0=Hm\u0415 Surprisingly not bad. Really. What's that song?
metropole_burden_leader_family.0.0=You're Jodie, right? Where's your mom? This is the captain of this ship.
metropole_burden_leader_family.9=Exactly. But Jodie likes it here, and how can I afford to be afraid? I have to keep up appearances... Anyway, Captain... When they were talking to me about safety, they didn't deny that the ship could get attacked. Is that true?
metropole_burden_leader_family.8=It's a very big ship! *The girl walks past in the background, concentrated on chewing the hard ship issue chocolate.* You know, it's as big as the neighborhood I used to live in. A neighborhood of metal and plastic, like some kind of bunker! Sometimes it feels very unusual. How do you live in here?
metropole_burden_leader_family.22=Likewise, Captain. *Smiling once again, the woman ends the video call.*
metropole_burden_leader_family.7=Oh, I get it. Something like the UN, right? I think that's a good thing. It's going to be interesting seeing it, Captain.
metropole_burden_leader_family.21=Sinn. *The woman smiles.* We still haven't been introduced. My name is Sinn.
metropole_burden_leader_family.6=The Unity space station? *Every muscle in the woman's face expresses her confusion.*
metropole_burden_leader_family.20=Yeah. She's a restless kid, so we tried to find something to keep her busy. *The woman laughs.* We did find her a hobby, but she didn't get any less restless... And as for the tune, it's some old song. It's the only one Jodie can play well and with no mistakes. I don't remember what song it is, exactly... My hubby used to listen to it when he was young. Something about hunting buffalo and poison in rivers.
metropole_burden_leader_family.5=Great. I thought we would fly faster or something. But I'm used to it by now!
metropole_burden_leader_family.4=Surprising, but I'm taking it better than a plane flight. *The woman turns her head towards the window.* But it makes you a bit uneasy to think that outer space is so close. Is it going to take much longer?
metropole_burden_leader_family.3=Thank you, Captain. Yeah, if there's one thing she really loves, it's playing her guitar. She even brought it with her... What is it you wanted, Captain?
metropole_burden_leader_family.2=*The girl tries to answer, but before she can do it you can hear the door opening. Female voice:* Jodie! What are you doing? *The girl jumps off and runs away.* The captain called, Mom, I answered, I answered!! *You can't hear the conversation after that, but in just a few moments the girl's mother comes up to the camera.* Good afternoon, Captain. I'm sorry, I wasn't around and Jodie knows how to use your gadgets, as it turns out... *The woman smiles.*
metropole_burden_leader_family.1=Mom isn't here, Uncle Captain! She just left, I wanted a chocolate bar and she went to get a chocolate bar! She'll be back soon!! *The girl jumps and for a split second her whole face appears on the screen.* Uncle Captain, I could play my guitar for you if you want! Do you want me to?! *Not waiting for your answer, she runs off somewhere offscreen and gets back right after that. She gets into the chair and you can't see most of her again. Instead, you can see the guitar's headstock. The girl, barely reaching the tuning pegs, adjusts them and begins to play. The song sounds sad to you.*
metropole_burden_leader_family.0=*No one answers your call for a long time. And then, finally... Hey, it's a child! A small girl is sitting in the chair in a way that leaves only the top of her head visible. You wonder how she managed to reach the screen and accept the call.* Who is it?! *The girl speaks too loudly and intensely.*
