sarah_about_herself.8.0=Pornos about me? Hm\u2026
sarah_about_herself.11=I don't like thinking about the past. It's better to look into the future, yeah?
sarah_about_herself.10=I worked, invented things, and then bam! And I was here. So it goes.
sarah_about_herself.7.0=Seriously, they're doing that?
sarah_about_herself.9=Cap, don't get distracted, we're not done yet. *Sara smirks sarcastically.* 
sarah_about_herself.6.4=Okay, that's all for now. Over and out, Sarah.
sarah_about_herself.6.3=And what happened after that?
sarah_about_herself.8=I don't know for sure, but probably. But that's not how you know you're famous. You know you're famous when they tell jokes about you. Or make pornos.
sarah_about_herself.6.2=Wow, I'm talking to a doctor of sciences.
sarah_about_herself.7=And I'm talking to a captain who probably has statues of him erected on Earth while he's still alive. Who's the lucky one here? 
sarah_about_herself.6.1=Tell me about the army.
sarah_about_herself.6=Ahem! *Sarah mimics choking on something.* I said I \"took part.\" The entire university was working on them, me included. Something about transforming the energy and breaking through the weakening gravity fields of stars... too long to explain, too many words. But in general, yeah, I liked my student years.
sarah_about_herself.6.0=Kibbutz?
sarah_about_herself.5=More boring than the army. But useful. That's where I started inventing things. Cap, did you know I took part in designing our hyperjump engines? 
sarah_about_herself.4=We got boiled and died. *She grimaces, but stops it right away.* Captain, what do you think? Of course we changed it.
sarah_about_herself.3=I liked the army, it was very fun. They taught me to shoot and to repair armor. Have I told you how we were stuck far away from the base once, and we spent the entire day changing the tank's track? And it was forty grades Celsius that day! And we were just six girls!
sarah_about_herself.2=Cap, I don't even remember, to be honest. *Sarah shrugs and looks into the camera without blinking.* It was a long time ago.
sarah_about_herself.1=Yeah, a Kibbutz. It's a sort of\u2026 uhhh\u2026 a village where everyone lives together and works together. And it had religious overtones in our case. Mom says we used to live in the city, but Dad took us there because of work\u2026
sarah_about_herself.0=I'm Sarah Frontz. I have five brothers and five sisters, and my mom and dad. I was born in the Flava Kibbutz, served in the army, then they sent me to a university, I got my PhD... Caaaap! This is boring as hell. I'm a great engineer, that's pretty much it.
