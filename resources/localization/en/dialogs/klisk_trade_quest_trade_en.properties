klisk_trade_quest_trade.12=That's it, then. *The Rogue signs the document, gets your signature, and smiles.* I'm happy with the deal. I hope you are, too.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.11=And the last thing. Second-hand microchips, one thousand five hundred. In return: new microchips, seven hundred. Money. Energy crystals, one thousand. *Noticing your confusion, the Rogue adds.* For autonomous work of mining modules. They use them at colonies. Colonizing equipment, seven hundred. Radioactive elements, two thousand.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.4.1=Okay. Let's get to it.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.10=Great. Now... spare parts for lathes for producing spaceships. Five thousand. In return: gold ore, five thousand. Or money. Or... *He rummages around in the papers.* There. Or lathes for asteroid mining. And random things, like, consumer goods... Ten thousand, they're light and compact. And pharmaceutical drugs, three thousand.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.4.0=You know, I'm not going to take responsibility for someone else's shipment. Thank you, that won't be necessary. Harkla, you take care of it. I'll be in my quarters.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.3.0=And if the stupid Bork was here instead of me, the one who was supposed to be the guard before I showed up?
klisk_trade_quest_trade.2.0=Why can't Harkla pick the necessary goods?
klisk_trade_quest_trade.12.0=Yeah, you hope. But I'm happy it was over so soon. I have to go.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.9=Eight hundred is less than one thousand. We need to add something.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.11.4=Radioactive elements. I hope they're sealed well.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.8=*The Rogue nods.* Trash for recycling, one thousand. In return: trash of a different kind, hah... Or geological equipment... it's very expensive, but we need to sell it off urgently, which is why we're selling it, three hundred. There are central processors, Zorsan made, seven hundred. There is also some Bork weaponry, two hundred, you understand that it isn't cheap. Or we could give you money.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.11.3=Colonizing equipment.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.7=Oh, I'm sorry. *The Rogue is embarrassed.* Of course. We can offer you the same kind of trash in return, for it to be recycled at Kliskada, since we don't work with it. Or I could give you its worth in money, or barter it for something.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.11.2=Energy crystals? Oh. I can't resist.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.1.0=Of course. What do I have to do?
klisk_trade_quest_trade.6=*Harkla hands over the papers and goes back into Dlorou's ship to oversee the shipment. The Rogue takes out the cargo manifest and reads it monotonously.* Trash for recycling, one thousand.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.11.1=Money.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.5=Okay. But we'll have to wait until Dlorou is better anyway.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.11.0=The microchips, of course.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.4=We would have waited until Dlorou got better. But the Bork isn't here. You are.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.3=He isn't authorized to.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.2=It's simple. Mr Harkla has all the documents, *the Klisk nods* he's Mr Dlorou's first mate. You only need to pick the goods you want loaded in return for the ones you unloaded, and sign the papers for it.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.9.3=Throw in a few rifles.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.1=*The shuttle lands. You approach the two.* Oh, human captain\u2026 I'm glad you've decided to do the deal.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.9.2=Throw in some processors\u2026 I'm joking! Load them carefully.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.0=*The airlock doors close behind your shuttle. Dlorou's transport ship takes up almost all of the space. You can see that the cargo hold doors are open and ready for a shipment. The now-familiar Rogue from the call is standing nearby. He's talking about something with some Klisk.*
klisk_trade_quest_trade.9.1=Load the equpiment.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.9.0=Throw in some credits for Dlorou.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.10.4=Pharmaceuticals? Hmmm. Not bad. Load them.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.10.3=Give me the consumer goods.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.0.0=\u2026
klisk_trade_quest_trade.10.2=Lathes for lathes? I think it's a wise decision.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.10.1=Money, of course.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.10.0=Load the gold ore.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.8.4=Weapons are always good. Load them.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.8.3=Central processors? Sounds intriguing.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.8.2=Expensive equipment? Load it. And don't let Dlorou tell you I didn't do my best.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.8.1=I'll take the money.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.8.0=Load the trash.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.7.0=Let's start over, then. But now list everything.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.6.0=And? What do I choose from? I don't know anything about this.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.5.1=What? Damn it. Okay. I don't want to stick around too long. Let's get this over with.
klisk_trade_quest_trade.5.0=Well, we'll wait, then.
