zorsan_battle_bork_arrive.1=A great force is coming to you. Yourselves, though... *The Bork grunts. Apparently, that means disapproval.* You get it. You won't make it on your own. Try not to get in our line of fire. If there's anything we know how to do... *He grunts again. The Bork bares his teeth, his eyes flicker.*...it's killing Zorsan.
zorsan_battle_bork_arrive.0=*You see a Bork face on your video communication screen. Judging from his eyes and more or less refined manners (he obviously isn't going to burp or to scratch his throat with his paw), the Bork you see before you is one of the smart ones.* Human captain? Hello. I'm Squadron Commander Forr. We've come here on orders from the Veteran Council to analyze the situation and make a decision.
zorsan_battle_bork_arrive.0.0=Right. So you're the help that Hrrraka promised us?
