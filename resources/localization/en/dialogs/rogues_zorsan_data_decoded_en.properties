rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.4.0=I gave you an order. Your job is to carry it out, not discuss it.
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.0.0=And what can you say? Are the Zorsan going to attack anyone else if they succeed with us?
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.5.0=Great. Over and out.
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.5=Aye, aye, Captain.
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.1.0=Are you positive? Did you double-check?
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.4=Of course, Captain. But I want you to know from the start that if our ruse is found out, the aliens definitely won't be happy. It could lead to even worse consequences.
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.3=Edits? Do you want our department to doctor information?
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.2=Affirmative, Captain.
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.1=No, Captain, they aren't. It would have been stupid from their point of view. According to this intel, when they occupy Earth, they're going to transfer their ruling class to it and clean up the planet. A new war would have been detrimental to them in that case.
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.2.1=Right. In that case, we don't have a choice. Make some edits to the source files.
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.0=*The analytics department of the Aurora calls you. Weird. Usually they contact you through Gordon. They must have something important this time.* Captain, we've studied the information you've gotten from Zorsan ships.
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.2.0=Damn it\u2026 Okay. Ready the drive. I think Hoor will provide us with some help despite there being no threat for him.
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.3.0=Yes, that's exactly what I want. Don't make it look like a major threat, just\u2026 what am I talking about? I'm not going to tell you how to do your jobs.
rogues_zorsan_data_decoded.4.1=I think you're right. Leave it as it is. Hoor will probably help us anyway.
