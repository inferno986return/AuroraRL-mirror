diplomacy_quest_results.80.0=Tell me what?
diplomacy_quest_results.82.0=Sounds cool. But it's hard to imagine it.
diplomacy_quest_results.280=The situation is terrible. Whether it's your fault or the aliens', I don't know\u2026 But that doesn't matter anymore. Not all is lost.
diplomacy_quest_results.84.0=I do. But there's no choice. If that's over with, what are my orders? 
diplomacy_quest_results.86.0=Yeah, it's some kind of ship. I remember. 
diplomacy_quest_results.0=Hmm, let me think\u2026
diplomacy_quest_results.88.0=Again, I'm sorry, Martan. I know it won't help anything, but still. 
diplomacy_quest_results.280.0=Not all?
diplomacy_quest_results.81.0=Yeah. And you still haven't told me what it is.
diplomacy_quest_results.180=I see you've done a good job, although it's far from perfect. All right. I think you'll want to know how we're going to use the help we received.
diplomacy_quest_results.0.2=\u2026
diplomacy_quest_results.0.1=\u2026
diplomacy_quest_results.83.0=The ace capable of destroying the enemy's entire fleet? 
diplomacy_quest_results.0.0=\u2026
diplomacy_quest_results.88=If you can, get a line on the attacker's plans. But don't risk yourself, and especially don't risk the Aurora 2. If we lose it, too, that's it. And don't forget about exploration and research. That is all. You can go. 
diplomacy_quest_results.87=It's not just a ship. It's a space flagship with the newest weaponry. A very powerful thing, but we only have the one, and I doubt our latest weaponry will impress those Zorsan too much. *Martan sighs.* If only your talks had gone well, we'd... Damn it. I can't even imagine what it would have given us. 
diplomacy_quest_results.86=Not all. We still have a chance. And that chance is the Voyager. I've mentioned it. 
diplomacy_quest_results.85.0=Some good news, at least. Okay. I'm leaving. 
diplomacy_quest_results.85=Try to find something out about the attacker's plans. But don't forget about intel and research. You can go. Oh, and they sent you something from the science department. I ordered it to be shipped to the Aurora 2, to the engineering deck. 
diplomacy_quest_results.84=Could be. Do you doubt it? 
diplomacy_quest_results.180.0=And how?
diplomacy_quest_results.83=With alien tech, the Voyager will become the ace in our sleeve. 
diplomacy_quest_results.82=The Voyager is our flagship. Three times as big as the Aurora 2, equipped with state of the art weaponry based on the railgun principle. The bleeding edge of our military technology. 
diplomacy_quest_results.81=All the weaponry and spare parts your aliens have given us will be used to upgrade the Voyager. I've mentioned it, remember? 
diplomacy_quest_results.87.0=I'm really sorry. You can't change anything\u2026 In any case, this isn't the time to lose heart. Any new orders?
diplomacy_quest_results.80=Well, then. You've done a great job. This is proof that we were right to assign you to the mission. I think... *Martan narrows his eyes and smiles.* I think I can tell you.
