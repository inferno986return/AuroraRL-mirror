sarah_gardener.0.0=What do you think?
sarah_gardener.1.2=So you say we leave our people behind?
sarah_gardener.1.1=Yes, I understand. But stilll\u2026 if he's seen the Aurora 1, that might help our search\u2026 
sarah_gardener.1.0=I see, Sarah. You're right. We have a different mission.
sarah_gardener.4=No, Cap, are you serious? I'd love to help our guys myself, but the planet is more important! It would be a bit stupid. Even the crew of the Aurora 1 would disapprove.
sarah_gardener.3=What can you do? Our planet is more important.
sarah_gardener.2.0=That's all for now. Over and out.
sarah_gardener.2=*Sarah smiles and nods.*
sarah_gardener.1=I don't think anything. *Sarah shrugs.* Maybe he's seen the Aurora 1, maybe he hasn't. We don't have time for that, anyway, right? And about the rest of it, like I said, Cap: I didn't understand anything. All that Philosophy of the Path business is a bunch of baloney to me.
sarah_gardener.0=Oh, Cap\u2026 The only thing I understood was that the guy had seen the first Aurora. And after that it's all gibberish. He's alien. Maybe it's okay that we can't understand him?
sarah_gardener.3.0=Yes. Of course. That's all for now.
sarah_gardener.4.0=Probably. But I still think we can't leave our people behind. That's all for now. Over and out.
