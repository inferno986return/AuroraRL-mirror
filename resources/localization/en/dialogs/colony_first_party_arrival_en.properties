colony_first_party_arrival.1=Sure we are. That little pet you brought back with you... *He lets out a laugh and his gut trembles under his suit.* If the entire fauna is like that, it definitely won't be easy. It's a good thing we're armed to the teeth. Do you think all that - the planet, the resources - is worth it?

colony_first_party_arrival.1.2=Nothing is worth dying for.
colony_first_party_arrival.6=*He can't hear you anymore. The shuttle door closes.* 
colony_first_party_arrival.1.1=Is it worth fighting for? Yes. Is it worth dying for? We'll see about that. 
colony_first_party_arrival.5=Ha! That's what I think, too. *He claps.* Good luck! You should know that this is a great beginning, Captain! 
colony_first_party_arrival.1.0=Of course it is, damn it.
colony_first_party_arrival.4=*The man laughs and gets into the shuttle. The door closes behind him. You had better leave the airlock.*
