marine_intro.12.0=Come on now, I'm intrigued!
marine_intro.11.2=Those are recent conflicts.
marine_intro.11.1=Zimbabwe. The Afrikaans Incident. 
marine_intro.6.0=Good. What else can you say? 
marine_intro.11.0=The five day blockade of Nicaragua? 
marine_intro.17=That's right. I am a pacifist.
marine_intro.10.2=Those are recent conflicts.
marine_intro.16=*Liszkiewicz responds with a smirk and a shrug.* I haven't gotten tired of it yet. You know\u2026 I have a routine check. I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave you. 
marine_intro.10.1=New Rhodesia? That's weird, that country doesn't exist. Neither does Cuba.
marine_intro.5.0=They were capable of anything on Earth. What about extra-terrestrial conditions? 
marine_intro.15=You're wrong. *Henry sighs.* I'm very much a regular soldier. Well... Almost. *Suddenly, his watch goes off. Henry looks at it and says:* I have a routine check. Chores. I will have to excuse myself. 
marine_intro.10.0=The five day blockade of Nicaragua? 
marine_intro.13=*Henry shakes his head.* War\u2026 Captain, I don't like thinking back to all that too much. War is a dirty business. 
marine_intro.12=I've forgotten about all the old ones. 
marine_intro.11=Exactly.
marine_intro.10=A mess of black and white people. But the color of their blood was the same: red. There was a lot of it. 
marine_intro.4.2=That's it for now. I have to go.
marine_intro.4.1=Okay\u2026 Henry, tell me about yourself.
marine_intro.4.0=Be more precise.
marine_intro.17.0=In that case, I don't understand you. You aren't like a regular soldier, Henry. 
marine_intro.3.3=Those are recent conflicts.
marine_intro.3.2=New Rhodesia? That's weird, that country doesn't exist. Neither does Cuba.
marine_intro.3.1=Zimbabwe. The Afrikaans Incident. 
marine_intro.3.0=The five day blockade of Nicaragua? 
marine_intro.16.0=Hm\u2026 Okay, then. I have to go, too. 
marine_intro.2.0=That takes care of the guns. What about the troops?
marine_intro.15.0=It's okay, Liszkiewicz, I have to go, too.
marine_intro.1.2=Just in the neighborhood. And I'm already leaving.
marine_intro.1.1=\"Or.\" I wanted to talk to you. It always helps to know the people you're serving with, especially your subordinates.
marine_intro.1.0=You can consider it a sort of inspection, Liszkiewicz. What are your responsibilities? What military capacity to we have? 
marine_intro.9=The Communist Front for Latin American Freedom. A four-man team was sent in against them. And in five hours, bam! *Henry shows you with his hands what exactly \"bam!\" means.* And the blockade was history. 
marine_intro.8=Sir, yes, sir. We're ready to fight whenever and wherever you want, and you can count on us.
marine_intro.7=Like I said, your troops are capable of anything. Doing battle, obviously, and also fixing up some vehicles should the need arise. Well, and if they really have to, they can perform a preliminary analysis of gathered materials, but don't expect too much: a soldier is always a soldier.
marine_intro.6=As long as they have the right equipment. The better a soldier's equipment is, the better his fighting capabilities. By the way, there's no such thing as perfect equipment.
marine_intro.9.2=Those are recent conflicts.
marine_intro.5=Every one of our soldiers has been through some excellent training. They really are capable of anything, just give the order.
marine_intro.9.1=New Rhodesia? That's weird, that country doesn't exist. Neither does Cuba.
marine_intro.4=I told you already. The best and exceptionally trained.
marine_intro.9.0=Zimbabwe. The Afrikaans Incident. 
marine_intro.3=*Henry nods and becomes thoughtful. It seems he is a bit rattled: you can see longing and melancholy in his narrowed eyes.* I've had to be in a few wars. Nicaragua, Zimbabwe, New Rhodesia, Cuba, of course... *Henry smirks and jerks his head in a strange way.* 
marine_intro.2=*Henry smirks again, but in about a second his smile disappears.* I'm responsible for the entire military component of the Aurora 2, from the ship's guns to the soldiers. Only the best guns and the best people are under your command. The laser battery is state of the art, capable of burning a hole through the Moon. However, I am against such reckless waste of power.
marine_intro.1=So you're here already. *Henry smirks.* Is this an inspection, or were you just in the neighborhood.
marine_intro.0.1=Yes. Me too.
marine_intro.0=*It is a ten minute walk to the military base. As you walk past the barracks, you can smell the heavy stench of sweat and unwashed feet, even though the air conditioning there is good. Weird. Anyway, you don't have to go to the barracks: Henry Liszkiewicz's office is a bit further away, closer to the weapon power supply systems. As you find out, the office isn't very spacious. Its owner is a tall man of that weird age some people get stuck in: he's definitely older than forty, but younger than one hundred. The soldier's face is covered in wrinkles. He gets up from his chair and gives you a short greeting.* Captain. Glad to meet you.
marine_intro.0.0=*extend your hand for a handshake in silence*
marine_intro.8.1=I can see you know your trade. Tell me about yourself.
marine_intro.13.1=Why? You speak like a pacifist. 
marine_intro.8.0=Great. I can see I'm lucky to have you. I think that'll be all, I have to go.
marine_intro.13.0=Why? Maybe you'll stop liking carrying out your responsibilities in the future, too? 
marine_intro.12.1=Okay. I have some business I have to attend to, too. See you, Liszkiewicz.
marine_intro.7.0=So you vouch for your men?
