klisk_1.76.0=What's the verdict?
klisk_1.74.0=See now? 
klisk_1.72.0=Indeed\u2030 Can you remind me the terms, please?
klisk_1.59.0=So, a thing, obtained for a decent price, is valuable, isn't it? What does it mean?
klisk_1.70.0=You're welcome. We will provide some information. *need to get through to Gordon, give him a command to prepare a data set of Earth's military history*
klisk_1.57.0=Hm\u2030 How do you know what things to exchange and for what to exchange them? Tell me about your Codex and its connection with the gardeners' philosophy of the Path. And how did you find the Codex? 
klisk_1.53.3=It is all a little bit\u2030 complicated, though, sure, it all makes sense. Now let me return to the charge: you tried to lie to me. 
klisk_1.53.2=How did gardeners get involved in it? Who are they? Gods?
klisk_1.53.1=The Codex\u2030 tell me about it and its connection with the philosophy of Path. 
klisk_1.53.0=Okay. What is the philosophy of Path? What's the point?
klisk_1.51.1=Because in such situation I don't think it's an impudence. I represent those who  are in a much worse position than you are. And any kind of non-cooperation seems like a nonsense or meanness. 
klisk_1.9.0=W-w-wait\u2030 So, the Trading Codex\u2030 ehm\u2030 is it your religion? 
klisk_1.51.0=Because, otherwise, my nation will answer with enmity and rage. And, believe me, though we aren't as developed as you are, you'd better beware our rage.
klisk_1.38.0=Clear. So, what do you want to know?
klisk_1.82=Dock then.
klisk_1.81=Our decision isn't absurd. You just don't understand us, yet now we understand you better. And that's how we see the way out... You will be given the coordinates of capital planets, and you can get information about their races under the same conditions. However, now we understand the situation on Earth better. You really need help. That's why the coordinates of a new planet are ready for sending. It is just a step away from Earth and it is suitable for future colonization. Though, its fauna will be against it... but that's not a problem for such a brave race like yours. 
klisk_1.80=Sure, about the military history. There are\u2030 a lot of wars. So identical and so different people\u2030
klisk_1.7.0=Is something wrong? Is it a private information? 
klisk_1.36.0=Perfect. Over. 
klisk_1.5.0=The Trading Codex?
klisk_1.34.0=Over. 
klisk_1.3.0=What deal?
klisk_1.32.0=Hm\u2030 So, one more time, what do you want for information about races?
klisk_1.19.1=Well, we're not interested in this aspect right now. I would like to connect other nations.
klisk_1.19.0=What kind of a transaction with gardeners did you talk about? They are strange creatures. The only thing I want is to understand them better.
klisk_1.79=*It took some time. The klisk is shocked, as you can see it by his look* This... this is unbelievable. Such coldness, but such a... 
klisk_1.78=In such case, commander, I give you the green light, you can dock now. Welcome to the station of klisks.
klisk_1.1.0=It's nice to see another soul friend. You are the second ones we've met - we were found by gardeners about a week ago.
klisk_1.77=The Codex forbids giving information for no reason. We can't leave you and your planet alone. That's why... we are still offering a trade. Information about you for information about any race. I really want to help you, so I will also tell you about my race, about Klisks. I can't tell you more. The Codex.
klisk_1.76=*It wasn't long until the video screen lights up. The klisk suddenly appears, distracting you from a little sandwich* The consultation is over, the Human commander. 
klisk_1.30.0=What do I need to do if I don't want to make such an exchange or simply I can't do it?
klisk_1.75=Yeah! Yes-yes-yes!! Certainly! *he stops clicking* But the Codex\u2030 I have to take advice! 
klisk_1.17.0=Interesting. So unsual... And what about zorsans? Or zorsan? 
klisk_1.74=You're awful. You're brave. A lot of deaths, such heroism... for what? For... for all these things... You're like borks, but you're not Borks... So terrible... it's so terrible on your planet! Everybody dies, dies! *he continues clicking, talking and galloping away*
klisk_1.73=*the klisk quickly examines the information. About three minutes, in service. Clicks, expressing his emotions, are silent now, then - quick. He's under the impression* Oh! Oh... How did you... you! You're... you're so strange!  
klisk_1.72=Information about any of the races will be a payment for yours one. See, that makes sense, you've come to a conclusion by yourself. Aren't you satisfied?
klisk_1.71=And what about the second phrase?
klisk_1.70=We\u2030 don't know if it's strange or not, but we want more details. Is it possible? 
klisk_1.9=Yes. There we can find knowledge about the right value of all and about the beneficial exchange. Klisks follow the Codex, and it shows Klisks the way to peace and prosperity.
klisk_1.15.0=Oh. And what can you say about zorsans and rogues?
klisk_1.8=*fast rhytmic clicks* Ts-ts-ts-ts. A bargain, bargain. It is good.
klisk_1.7=*fast clicks, unregulated rhythm. Seemingly, he is anxious*
klisk_1.6=Anything that can bring profit.
klisk_1.5=Klisks. Believe me, the translation of the word will explain nothing. My nation has been living and trading since the beginning of time, the Trading Codex leads us. 
klisk_1.4=Doesn\u2022t matter. *clicks again* They were right. If you want to connect other races, you go to klisks. Klisks are the best dealers in the whole Cluster.
klisk_1.3=Kinda strange. Gardeners made a deal with us... But they didn't do it with you.
klisk_1.13.1=Borks? Zorsans? Rogues?
klisk_1.2=*the klisk twitches. At least, it looked alike* Ts-ts-ts-ts! *The klisk clicks like an animal* Have they sold you the information? Have they? What kind of information?
klisk_1.13.0=Well\u2030 And what, is it only the information? What else do you sell? Don't even know\u2030 maybe, some kind of repair details? Medical supplies?
klisk_1.1=Good\u2030 *the creature clicks wierdly* Klisks. We are klisks.
klisk_1.0=*on a video screen you see a creature. You can't understand its emotions, though it doesn't seem to be agressive* You... Who are you? 
klisk_1.11.0=You're in a better position to judge.
klisk_1.69.2=Any information costs money, and it's not only me who said this.
klisk_1.82.0=All correct. Starting to dock. Over.
klisk_1.69.1=Nobody tried to subdue. We - humans - we are... don't know how to call it. Way too agressive? Or just too different? There always were some reasons for war and killing. You know, I could tell you a lot about this, but a couple of phrases will be enough... The first one is \"war is blood, fear and death\". 
klisk_1.69.0=It is strange to hear your surprise. I'm sure, your nation had been at war against each other at least before you went to space. Though, you're right: Earth is an instable planet. There were a couple of world wars on our planet. At the same time, some smaller conflicts haven't quieted down even now. And, trust me, if you don't change your position, there will be more of them.
klisk_1.69=Why are you so suspicious? I can understand it from a theoretical perspective, but not from a practical one. Have you seen a lot of wars? With whom? Have somebody tried to subdue your planet?
klisk_1.68=Well, that's what you think\u2030 *clicks. As if the klisk is laughting* Why? 
klisk_1.67=A silly joke? Do you really think you can afford such jokes in  a serious conversation? I wish you good luck, commander. To be specific, I wish you a good mind. Elsewise, you will have these stupid habits until you face borks.
klisk_1.66=No, it's not. You still can buy anything you want around here. But we don't want to sell you weapons that later will be aimed at us. 
klisk_1.80.0=I doubt it will make the situation better if you continue to stand your ground and defend your absurd decision.
klisk_1.65=A silly joke... Based upon one representative, your nation is stupid, explosive, and unpredictably coward. If you want to threaten klisks, why don't you go to the very end? We don't tolerate such jokes. Now our help is only in your dreams.
klisk_1.67.0=Oh, listen, please!
klisk_1.64=*clicks. The klisk turns his back on you and literally emerges from the screen - obviously working with some kind of a computer. Only a few minutes later, he appears on the screen* You have refused to follow the Codex, commander. At the same time, you rejected a gift of Klisks without any obvious reason. Furthermore, the war is bad. It's stupid. In our case, it is irrational and harmful for trade. So here's our answer. Coordinates of capital planets are already sent to you, commander, because we believe in your common sense. But the fear of war makes us stop trading with your people and providing military support for them. I'm afraid, any ammunition,  upgrades, as well as the weapons are unavailable for you now.
klisk_1.63=What's our stupidity? What's our meanness?
klisk_1.62=Oh\u2030 Sorry. Do you threaten\u2030 threaten Klisks with war? 
klisk_1.61=More' will include klisks' point of view. You need to know your point of view before knowing others'.
klisk_1.60=You should understand it on your own.
klisk_1.65.0=Listen, it really was a\u2030
klisk_1.63.0=You refused to give us help. This trade is the example of stupidity. Sharing information about your neighbours isn't harder than giving the coordinates of capital planets. We don't need private information, after all! Your meanness is your aggressive refusal! You know, it seems like an attempt to make us do bad things. 
klisk_1.61.1=Can you give more information about the Codex? What is it? And what is the philosophy of path? 
klisk_1.61.0=It was a little bit rude, though I got the point. I think, we'd talk about it, when I'll understand it better. As for now, why did you try to lie to me? 
klisk_1.48.1=You know, I would like you to tell me some things again. What is the reward for the additional information? 
klisk_1.48.0=Hm\u2030 It is rather profitable. When do we start?
klisk_1.59=Klisks have been following the Codex since the ancient times - from the dawn of my race to its current condition. Information in it was up to time and place. The connection between the Codex and the gardeners' philosophy is very simple - as the philosophy says that opposition creates everything in this life and the Codex states that the true value becomes completely clear only after a deal. Before a deal the object is absolutely usless. Only thing, obtained for a decent price, is valuable. Besides, by getting money to pay the price, you're making a lot of other deals, strengthening yourself in many other aspects. 
klisk_1.58=Oh, no, gardeners aren't Gods. They have their own Path, and they got farther than the other races. It is all I can say now.
klisk_1.57=Klisks follow the Codex from the ancient times. In the beggining, the Codex said what is good and what is bad. What things to follow, and what things to avoid. And now, it has been modified, and it says what is worthy of exchange and what is not. There are things so valuable, that their titles are listed with the exact wording of things they're worth.
klisk_1.46.0=Right. So, what about information? 
klisk_1.54=The philosophy of the Path - everything flows, everything changes. Things have certain prices, because if nobody wants to buy it then it is useless. It's hard to explain, the Human commander. You need to understand your own philosophy of the Path. 
klisk_1.53=Hm\u2030 Commander, it's hard to explain. Gardeners follow the philosophy of Path. We also follow it, whether we want it or not. Yes, it may be said that the Exchange Codex is partially connected with the philosophy of Path... But just partially. 
klisk_1.52=Why are you asking?
klisk_1.51=Is it so hard to understand? Or  have stopped trying to do that? Commander\u2030 Commander! Why do you think you can ask for more than we offer?
klisk_1.44.2=Do you want to get information for free?
klisk_1.44.1=The energy crisis chokes my planet. Our first spaceship that was sent to find a planet for a future colonization has dissapeared. As you can understand, a huge resposibility lies on me.
klisk_1.50=I'm not going to deceive you. You have misunderstood me. The Codex -  that's what's important, there is no lie in it. You can have general information, but not more - klisk doesn't want  to share information for free, furthermore - we can't do it, it is very bad. Maybe you just can't get the point, we follow the rules of the Codex. It's our path! 
klisk_1.44.0=Sorry, but no. As I said before, it's closed information. Also, I want to hear your offers for my data. 
klisk_1.42.0=Do you mean a history book? 
klisk_1.29.0=A discount is always good. So, what about the payment? 
klisk_1.40.0=Thank you for the hospitality. Over.
klisk_1.27.1=Anyway, I wouldn't like to wade into those waters. I have a lot of responsibility already, so for now I would like just to have the coordinates.
klisk_1.27.0=Do you think so?
klisk_1.49=As soon as you dock your spaceship, the Human commander. You are welcome. 
klisk_1.48=Yes, you call it so.
klisk_1.25.0=Humanity is a young race. We have recently come to space! And you're trying to get us into a strange trade, motivating it with some weird arguments. It seems like a bluff, and, I'm not sure if you know this term - a speculation! 
klisk_1.47=*rapid clicks of laughter* You've learnt a lot during this conversation... Story of you for a story of klisks. Is it a go?
klisk_1.46=Oh. *slow clicks* Sure, no offence. You wanted to talk about the quantity of information. 
klisk_1.45=\"Oh\u2030 I feel sorrow for your trouble. *clicks rapidly, then slows down
klisk_1.44=That is interesting. Can you tellme a little bit more? Klisks need any information.
klisk_1.43=Problems with space? *clicks interestedly* Please, tell me more.
klisk_1.42=A biological report is a scan and few tests. Physical, psychological ones... As for the historical background - we'll just need a simple... *it took some time until the device finds an appropriate word* simple book with information. Do you have such things?
klisk_1.23.0=What\u2022s the price?
klisk_1.41=Don't hesitate, it's an obvious question. When we have the information about you, we will have a notion what kind of attendance your nation needs. There's also a general and academic interest. I think you understand the fact that it is impossible to injure you, knowing about your biological and historical information. 
klisk_1.40=In this case, I will give an order to open the dock. Welcome to the trade station, the Human commander!
klisk_1.21.1=I got your point. In such case, I have a question for you. I was told to get in touch with the nearest developed civilizations. I think, your help would be very useful.
klisk_1.21.0=Codex? What codex?
klisk_1.79.0=Are you talking about my officer? Or is it about the military history of Earth? 
klisk_1.77.0=I have to say, it is rational. Yes, rational, for sure.
klisk_1.39=It's a pity, but stuff happens. Anyway, if you change your mind, I will be glad to explain it again. Dock now, I have given an order to prepare a dock. You are welcome. 
klisk_1.38=Everything is quite simple. Firstly, if you are going to make contacts with other races, you don't have to be... *slow clicks* that dark. That secretive. Secondly, if klisks know you well, their trades will be more profitable, and the other races will understand you better. However, if there is something you're doubting, I will not insist on giving me this information. 
klisk_1.75.0=Apparently, I'll have to wait.
klisk_1.37=It depends on quality and quantity\u2030 You will have a nice bonus for a full biological report, plus a good historical background. It's hard to say exactly now, you know. 
klisk_1.36=I'm glad we've come to agreement. Dock now, commander, the dock for your spaceship is ready.
klisk_1.35=It's a pity. However, it's up to you. Anyway, dock now,  the rest we'll discuss in person.
klisk_1.34=Dock now, commender. Glad to see you on this station. Over.
klisk_1.33=I'm sure you have a lot to offer - and, as for me, I'll find an opportinity to pay for that. The Codex says, if you are in a position to close a transaction - you need to do it, 'cause it brings a mutual benefit and a close friendship. 
klisk_1.32=A stable price for general information is seven credits. Price depends on details. 
klisk_1.31=You don't have to worry. It is a rational  decision, it excellently characterizes you. This link will be free, as soon as your meeting ends - connect us immediately. 
klisk_1.73.0=Eh, sorry?
klisk_1.30=All the better. If you want to save your money or spend them on another things, we will be glad to exchange information. After all, the Codex says, that money is the most powerful balancer and the best payment, but sometimes it is better to exchange similar things, 'cause it'll make a greater profit in a long run. 
klisk_1.71.0=The war never changes. And I know who can tell you about it. *connect Henry, give him a command to join the private communication line with klisk*
klisk_1.58.0=No more? 
klisk_1.54.2=How did gardeners get involved in it? Who are they? Gods?
klisk_1.54.1=The Codex\u2030 tell me about it and its connection with the philosophy of the Path.
klisk_1.29=Oh... What a surprise to meet such a prepared creature. Better for you, the Human commander. In such situation, if you want, you can get a little discount for a first purchase. You'll have a 10% discount on anything you want. Just out of respect for you.  
klisk_1.54.0=Well\u2030 yeah. For me it is quiet hard to understand what you mean, but we had something like that on Earth. I'll take an on-line encyclopedia to check it when I have time. Now let's return to the excharge. Why did you try to lie to me?  
klisk_1.28=So you prefer a stable currency, don't you? I think, it may be rational. Sure thing, you can sell your information for credits.
klisk_1.27=Sure, it's your choice. However, trust me, you are losing a great opportinity...
klisk_1.26=It depends on things you want to give. You can just give some basic information about you and your nation. It will be enough to make an exchange. 
klisk_1.25=Where are we being\u2030 *random clicks, now loud, then silent* unfair to you? 
klisk_1.24=You may pay with credits: seven credits for information about any race, even Klisks. But I guess, you have no money for that. If I'm right, we can exchange information about your civilization for our information about any race. We believe it is an even trade. However, if you have money, we will be glad to have a cash payment.
klisk_1.23=Codex says about a deal, but a deal might not happen... If you need the coordinates of capital planets, you can get them for free. Godwill gesture. *clicks are hasty, gradually slowing down* Furthermore, I'll provide you with information, that will not only help you to establish a diplomatic contact, but also will give an opportunity to gain a benefit for your civilization. That is the deal. You will have to pay. 
klisk_1.22=He leads us.
klisk_1.52.0=We are looking for a spaceship that has dissapeared recently. When we met for the first time, the gardener let us know that he knew the location of the spaceship, but he refused to give us more detailed information - he said, that it wasn't our path, and we have to find it on our own. 
klisk_1.21=The information costs credits. Codex doesn't allow to give information for free. As for this new information, it is forbidden to share even for credits. For now.
klisk_1.39.0=It's a pity, but stuff happens. Over. 
klisk_1.20=No. We've just figured something out about gardeners.
klisk_1.37.4=What if I don't want to share all the information? 
klisk_1.50.2=Fine. I have to agree with you. Can you please repeat the terms?
klisk_1.37.3=Let's get back to the methods of payment.
klisk_1.50.1=The Codex is your path, you said? I have heard it before. The Path\u2030 Path\u2030 Right. The gardener! He was talking about the path! Is your Codex connected with gardeners? 
klisk_1.37.2=Could you please be more specific? A full biological report and a good historical background - it's a loose concept. 
klisk_1.8.0=\u2030
klisk_1.50.0=You must be kidding me. Why are you trying to mess with my head? What's the difference between a couple of words and a dozen of them? Why don't you want to help my nation to take a rightful place among you? 
klisk_1.37.1=With all due respect, I still need an answer for the question, 'why do you need so detailed informarion about my race?' 
klisk_1.37.0=Perhaps, I'm satisfied.
klisk_1.6.0=Hm\u2030 Useful minerals? Planets? Everything is a pretty loose concept. 
klisk_1.35.0=Over.
klisk_1.4.3=Yes, we want to know something about other civilizations and connect them. Also to establish contacts, conclude an agreement about the mutual military collaboration and so on.
klisk_1.4.2=As for the deal. Why isn't it important? What kind of deal did you make?
klisk_1.4.1=What are you selling?
klisk_1.4.0=Klisks?.. Tell me about your race.
klisk_1.33.1=Anyway, I have to refuse.
klisk_1.33.0=Good, then let's discuss the terms of trade. What do you want for information about races?
klisk_1.19=There are five types of races. They're divided by several factors: biological, physcological, behavioural...  It's not really important. An important point is that different types of races are really very different. A second type race can't come in contact with a third type race - due to some physical reasons and mutual misunderstanding. Klisks can establish  such contact. And it comes at a price, a very high price.
klisk_1.18=Nothing. Zorsans are young. They think they are an empire, and they're aggressive. They're like borks, but a bit mor civilized. They haven't understood yet that there is there is a place for everybody in Cluster... They will understand it. Eventually. 
klisk_1.17=Rogues. Years ago they had their own planet, but they left it - I don't know the details, but it was far-far away, ages ago. Nowadays their motherland is a conglomerate of giant motherships. Earlier rogues provided us with all information we needed, 'cause they are space nomads and they constantly explore it. However... recently *he says a word, an interpreter explains it like \"fifty years ago\"* they have reduced their activity. It's bad for us.
klisk_1.2.0=No, we didn't have any deals. We had a strange conversation... Gardeners told us to contact you, they said it'd make the connection with other civilizations easier.
klisk_1.16=There are more\u2030 Some unusual things. They aren't similar to each other. It might be traces of some lost civilizations. Or maybe it's some rare resources. We don't really know. All worthful things will find their buyers. 
klisk_1.18.2=Okay. But now let's talk about information. You know, my nation has only recently mastered the technology of interstellar travelling. I was instructed to establish a diplomatic contact with every developed civilizations I meet. 
klisk_1.15=An information costs credits... Anyway, the general information is free. You are talking about the second type race. Borks. They are aggressive and dumb, yet not all of them. If somebody attacks without any obvious reason, it is a bork. 
klisk_1.31.0=Thank you. Over.
klisk_1.18.1=What kind of a transaction with gardeners did you talk about? They are strange creatures. The only thing I want is to understand them better. 
klisk_1.14=*clicks again, seems like a laughter* You're funny. Sure, we have everything travellers might ever need. I thought you meant something unusual.
klisk_1.18.0=Do races divide into types? You meantioned that borks are a second type. What did you mean? 
klisk_1.13=The most valuable thing is knowledge, information. Cluster is infinite and undiscovered. Klisks, and borks, and zorsans, and even rogues want to know about everything around them. The more dateiled information is, the higher its price. You'll have almost nothing for a new system's map, but you'll have a lot for a full scan of all planets and collecting their genetical, geological examples.
klisk_1.12=*slow and drawling clicks. Seems like a laughter.* No, we trade everything, but such useless things. Maybe it will surprise you, but Cluster is infinite. It extends every second. Everybody will be satisfied with planets and resources. It would be a foolish thing to trade.
klisk_1.11=You're not a klisk. You can't understand it.
klisk_1.10=No! *the klisk clicks again, but now clicks are more frequent* Klisks left it behind. The Trading Codex is something different. As I said before, there is knowledge about the right value of all and about the beneficial exchange.
klisk_1.0.0=We're from Earth, we're representatives of the human race. This is our first contact with your race.
klisk_1.16.0=Good. Who are borks? Zorsans? Rogues?
klisk_1.14.0=Sorry, it is all new for me. So, you trade information. Is it the only thing you sell? 
klisk_1.12.0=So, even here the big bang theory is popular. Good. Anyway, what are you selling? 
klisk_1.10.0=Fine, not a religion, but a phylisophy of life. Anyway, it seems to be strange.
klisk_1.81.0=I'm pleasantly surprised you understand the problems of my planet. It's not ideal, but it's better than none.
klisk_1.68.0=What do you mean why?
klisk_1.66.0=Listen, wait! *the klisk breaks the private connection, you're staring into an empty screen*
klisk_1.64.0=Wait, it's an absurd!
klisk_1.62.1=No-no, don't say that! It was.. it was a silly joke. Yeah. Just a silly joke.
klisk_1.62.0=You got me right.
klisk_1.49.0=Thank you. Over.
klisk_1.60.1=How did gardeners get involved in it? Who are they? Gods? 
klisk_1.60.0=Okay then. I think we've talked enough, let's get to business\u2030 You tried to lie, klisk.
klisk_1.47.1=Unfortunately, no. It is better not to give publicity to some things. You haven't answered the question about my reward yet.
klisk_1.47.0=Sure. Starting to dock.
klisk_1.45.0=Yes, of course. Repeat your terms, please. 
klisk_1.43.2=It is a secret. I'm not allowed to spill the beans. Hope you'll understand. 
klisk_1.43.1=It's hard to explain. Nowadays my planet is facing hard times - it's all because of the energy crisis. Besides, the first spaceship has dissapeared, and it hit a raw nerve of our civilization. My spaceship is the second one and the last one, so I have no right to fail my mission. 
klisk_1.43.0=Let's say, my spaceship isn't the first one humanity has launched to explore the universe. We had another one, now it's lost. I can't tell you more.
klisk_1.41.1=Oh. Then\u2030 I suppose\u2030 I agree. 
klisk_1.41.0=You're right, but\u2030 My nation has certain problems with space, so I don't want to make it worse.
klisk_1.28.0=How much will you pay for a general information about my nation? And what's the cost of the more more detailed information?
klisk_1.26.4=Say again, what do you want for information about races?
klisk_1.26.3=However, I have to refuse.
klisk_1.26.2=I think my question is rather clear: why do you need information about my nation? 
klisk_1.26.1=What will I get if my information is more detailed?
klisk_1.26.0=That's the way I want to do it.
klisk_1.24.6=You know, I want to convene an officer council. We need to discuss this question. Hope, you will understand my decision and won't get me wrong.
klisk_1.24.5=You are mistaken, we do have money.
klisk_1.24.4=Your offer flatters us, but, unfortunately, it is useless for us. We already have your coordinates.
klisk_1.24.3=Hm. So one can exchange information about himself for information about somebody else, am I right? Can I just sell you the information you need?
klisk_1.24.2=I don't really think I am allowed to give you such information about my civilization. I guess I'll give you only the coordinates.
klisk_1.24.1=Hm. Information for information... What do you want to know about my race?
klisk_1.24.0=Listen, I think, it's not fair. 
klisk_1.22.0=Leads you? You mean, laws or principles? 
klisk_1.20.0=What's that?
klisk_1.78.0=Thank you. Docking. Over.
