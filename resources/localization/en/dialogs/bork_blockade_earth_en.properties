bork_blockade_earth.3.0=I told you: the Borks aren't very smart. 
bork_blockade_earth.4.0=My rules of engagement? 
bork_blockade_earth.0.0=You mean the blockade?
bork_blockade_earth.5=However you want them. But keep in mind that a full-scale fire show on Earth's orbit will cause panic on the planet. Do we really need that? 
bork_blockade_earth.5.0=I'll try to avoid doing that, but I can't promise you anything. All right, I have to go. 
bork_blockade_earth.4=Well, it's not my place to tell you how to deal with this. They just have to go. 
bork_blockade_earth.3=And it doesn't bother them that those Klisks, whoever they are, don't trade with us at all yet? 
bork_blockade_earth.1.0=They're Borks. Most of them are very aggressive and not very smart. 
bork_blockade_earth.2=What do they want from us, then? 
bork_blockade_earth.1=What else? We are completely blocked from going to space: they intercept everything, check it, and send it back. Who are they? What the hell? 
bork_blockade_earth.0=I think you can tell me about what's happening around the planet. 
bork_blockade_earth.2.1=Why the hell knows? They probably want to rob. I should contact them and find out. 
bork_blockade_earth.2.0=They want to rob Klisk ships, but the main trading spots are already taken. So they came here.
