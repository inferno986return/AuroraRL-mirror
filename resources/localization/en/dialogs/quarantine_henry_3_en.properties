quarantine_henry_3.3=Yes, sir! *Henry presses the button that opens the door, then falls unconscious. You can see someone giving him a shot very quickly and putting him on the bed. Apparently, his unconscious state crossed over into sleep. The doctors say that Henry will wake up soon and he'll be feeling better.*

He gulps it down in one go, choking and grunting.* It helps a bit... It helps... *He coughs again.* I wanted to say th-that... if... if I don't... *Coughs.* It was an honor... an honor...
