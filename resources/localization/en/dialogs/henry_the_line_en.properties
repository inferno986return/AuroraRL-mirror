henry_the_line.2.0=Of course.
henry_the_line.4.0=Yeah, it didn't go very well.
henry_the_line.9=It's just... no reason, Captain. At first I was young, then I wasn't. You know, someone once said that war never changes. And some say it actually has changed. I think that's all wrong. War doesn't change, but it changes people. You go through one, and you become a different person. A worse one or a better one? *Henry taps the Bible on his desk and adds:* It's probably the latter. Yeah.
henry_the_line.6.2=No. I couldn't.
henry_the_line.8=I was watching that movie and remembering the wars. The ones I was part of. The conflicts.
henry_the_line.6.1=I don't know, Henry. I can't tell you. I've never been in such situations\u2026 although\u2026 no, no I haven't.
henry_the_line.7=*Henry nods, and he doesn't look like he wants to say anything.*
henry_the_line.6.0=You might get surprised at my answer, but yes. I could.
henry_the_line.6=Umm\u2026 I'll ask it in a different way. Could you forgive yourself if you knew that your actions, well-intentioned as they may be, have led and will lead to the deaths of hundreds of people, at the very least? Children? And your intentions really are good.
henry_the_line.5=And in the end, he forgave himself. *Henry is silent.* Do you think it was the right thing to do?
henry_the_line.4=Yeah. Yeah, that's the one... It... That man who... *Henry is gritting his teeth and squinting. Is he nervous?* He wanted the best for everyone. He wanted to save everyone in that city, in Dubai. But he turned out the main villain himself.
henry_the_line.3=It's about that movie that we watched in the theater. The war movie.
henry_the_line.8.0=And\u2026
henry_the_line.2=We need to talk. *He won't say any more.* So are you free right now?
henry_the_line.11.0=That was weird.
henry_the_line.1=Sure\u2026 of course. It's nothing. I'm sorry I interrupted, Captain. *He signs off without letting you answer.*
henry_the_line.0=*A call from Henry, completely out of nowhere.* Captain? Can you\u2026 *he's faltering a little.* Can you talk?
henry_the_line.1.0=Weird.
henry_the_line.3.0=\"The Line?\"
henry_the_line.11=Could be. But\u2026 still\u2026 It just came over me. Nevermind, Captain. It's nothing. I'm just an old man who got the urge to talk. *he signs off*
henry_the_line.10=Could be. It's just, you know... that choice in the ending\u2026 it would have been great if it were like that in real life. So easy.
henry_the_line.5.0=What do you mean?
henry_the_line.7.0=So\u2026 why are you asking all that?
henry_the_line.10.0=You took it too seriously.
henry_the_line.0.2=No, sorry. Can we do it later?
henry_the_line.9.0=It's weird that the movie moved you so much.
henry_the_line.0.1=Why, what is it?
henry_the_line.0.0=Of course.
henry_the_line.2.1=No, sorry. Can we do it later?
