rogues_altar_1.0=*One of the aliens called the Rogues is looking at you. Behind his back, you can see about a dozen of his compatriots setting up something like a small obelisk, a pole about five meters tall. However, this thing is vibrating and blinking its lights.* I know you. You're humans. By the Essence of the Devourer, I greet you.
rogues_altar_1.3.0=Well, then. Okay. It's very unusual, but I don't have any right to get in your way. Good luck. I have to go.
rogues_altar_1.0.0=Devourer? Um\u2026 Nevermind. Can I ask you what you're doing here?
rogues_altar_1.2.0=So you're just going to pray here? No funny business?
rogues_altar_1.3=I understand. We only have handguns. And the Altar is just an altar.
rogues_altar_1.2=You call it Sun? It has a nice ring to it. We'll pray. Pray to the Essence of the Devourer, and the Essence of your\u2026 Sun. I said it right.
