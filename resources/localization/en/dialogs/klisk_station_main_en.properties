klisk_station_main.9.2=Well, then, are you going to cooperate with us?
klisk_station_main.9.1=What, are the Zorsan really that hostile?
klisk_station_main.9.0=The Bork factor?
klisk_station_main.8.2=Well, then, are you going to cooperate with us?
klisk_station_main.8.1=What, are the Zorsan really that hostile?
klisk_station_main.8.0=The Rogues' fanaticism? What's the Obliterator?
klisk_station_main.7.3=*wait for Eroloa to take a sip*
klisk_station_main.7.2=What, are the Zorsan really that hostile?
klisk_station_main.7.1=The Rogues' fanaticism? What's the Obliterator?
klisk_station_main.7.0=The Bork factor?
klisk_station_main.6.0=Not exactly. I allowed myself to learn a little about the Klisks before coming here.
klisk_station_main.38=Your escort will take you there. Kahha! I'm glad that you've decided to help us.
klisk_station_main.37=The fleet has to be guarded.
klisk_station_main.36=Exactly. Just escort the trade fleet there and back. It's an easy job. Kahha!
klisk_station_main.5.1=Hm. And what does the Code say about it?
klisk_station_main.35=That is wonderful. In that case... excuse me... *Eroloa turns towards the phone again.* Gentlemen, I've found you a guard. Not, he's smart. Not a Bork. No, not a Rogue. Human. Kahha! From Earth. Kahha! I don't care. The Code says... *He gets a fervent speech in response. He waits patiently.* Your proposition is accepted, but we don't have a choice. Wait for the new guard. Thank you.
klisk_station_main.5.0=I'll try. Even if it doesn't happen right away, cooperation will benefit both of us. For example, cultural exchange. You're more technologically advanced, but the gap isn't unbreachable.
klisk_station_main.34=*Eroloa smiles.* They won't. Captain, don't waste my time.
klisk_station_main.33=*He shakes his head no and coughs.* No. I'm not talking about helping me\u2026 Kahha! Although I'll say no to that, too. We cannot help you, human captain. I'm sorry.
klisk_station_main.98=More information. Hurry up with your answer, Captain. It all depends on you. I would say that the fate of the relationship between our planets is in your hands.
klisk_station_main.32=*He is still coughing.*
klisk_station_main.31=*Eroloa thinks for a while. He empties his glass in one swig and coughs for a long time.*
klisk_station_main.30=Was there anything else?
klisk_station_main.4.0=Have you received the information package?
klisk_station_main.3.0=Okay. We're humans, from planet Earth, Earthlings. I represent my people. We want diplomatic cooperation with the Klisks.
klisk_station_main.2.0=\u2026.
klisk_station_main.1.0=I understand. I've been told you're serious about tradition.
klisk_station_main.29=You know what? *Eroloa waves his hand.* I'll try to help you. It won't be easy, but\u2026 *he smiles* Come see me in a month.
klisk_station_main.28=Oh. Too bad\u2026 Kahha! Too bad\u2026 I cannot help you. *You can see great pain in Eroloa's face.* I am an official employee of the Vortangu Company. I am not allowed to meddle with Hakazar affairs.
klisk_station_main.27=Oh, of course. Who am I to make you do it? *Eroloa makes a call.* Find it yourselves. Yes. *He hangs up.* I think we're done, human captain. Was there anything else? Don't hesitate to ask.
klisk_station_main.26=It doesn't matter. The chances of an attack are very small. Do you agree? You could say no\u2026 Kahha! I'm not obliging you.
klisk_station_main.0.0=The pleasure is mine.
klisk_station_main.25=*Eroloa takes a sip from the glass.* We have a little problem. A small trading fleet that was supposed to take off an hour ago is unguarded. *He frowns.* The stupid escort Bork got into a fight on the way here, and ended up in the atmosphere of some planet while on a super-heavy cruiser... The cruiser and the Bork are no more.
klisk_station_main.24=Yes. No. Yes. I told you to find one! What? I can't hear- *With a surprising grace for someone his size, Eroloa turns around and looks at you. He shouts into the receiver.* Call back in... Kahha! Ten minutes. *He puts the receiver back.* Human captain, I have a proposition for you.
klisk_station_main.23=Nonsense! You have to be proud of yourself! You've gotten impressive\u2026 Kahha! Results!
klisk_station_main.22=*And you do. In just a few minutes, the Aurora sends over the package of information that Eroloa needs. You shudder to imagine how much data it contains. Eroloa glances over it, only reading the most important parts, but even that takes forty minutes, during which you burrow a small hole in the chair with your ass.* Hm... Kahha! Yeah... Well, then. *Eroloa smiles, exceptionally happy with himself.* Cooperation definitely makes sense. We'll do great things together. Especially if people like you represent Earth.
klisk_station_main.21=You'll get it.
klisk_station_main.20=Of course. You have to be proud of having done it all by yourself.
klisk_station_main.19.0=Is this a yes?
klisk_station_main.29.0=Oh, of course. Thank you.
klisk_station_main.18.1=\u2026.
klisk_station_main.18.0=I think\u2026 I'm not going to rush it. What exactly do you need?
klisk_station_main.19=*The Klisk listens to your disconnected tale, sometimes coughing or watering his throat. Is five minutes a long time? And what if it's filled with information?* I understand you, human captain. I don't think it's going to be something grand... but cooperation with you does make sense.
klisk_station_main.18=Of course it is\u2026 *Eroloa smiles encouragingly.* I'm ready to listen to you.
klisk_station_main.17=Kahha! *Eroloa drinks from the glass again. He crawls away to pour some more and comes back.* Let's give it a more serious name: a battle test. You passed it. According to the Code, Captain, I cannot decline your proposal. The Code says that he who proposes friendship wins twice. And he who accepts it, thrice.
klisk_station_main.16=I don't know whether our cooperation will be productive, but you know how to keep secrets. Congratulations.
klisk_station_main.28.0=So what do I do?
klisk_station_main.15=Hm\u2026 Well, then. Human captain! *Eroloa crawls back a little.*
klisk_station_main.17.0=It's good. I'm glad we can cooperate.
klisk_station_main.14=Are you sure about your decision? Do you understand you can ruin it all?
klisk_station_main.13=It could help you. Kh\u2026 *Eroloa stops coughing and suddenly looks at you very seriously.* Hurry up with your answer, Captain. It all depends on you. I would say that the fate of the relationship between our planets is in your hands.
klisk_station_main.12=It's all empty words, do you understand? And we're talking seriously here... I need to know what you can give us, so that we can see what we give you. These are the laws of trade and profit, human captain. *Eroloa waves his trembling hand.*
klisk_station_main.27.2=There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. It won't happen today or tomorrow, we have almost two years... but still. We are at completely different stages of development. My planet needs help, or we will lose.
klisk_station_main.11=*Eroloa wipes his lips* Cooperate\u2026 hm\u2026 well, we'll be friends for starters. And then... Kahha! Then is then. *The phone rings again. Eroloa turns toward it, picks up the receiver and listens attentively.*
klisk_station_main.38.0=\u2026.
klisk_station_main.27.1=Yeah, there is something. Recently, a trade bot has come to my planet's orbit, and it's ruining all of our communications. I found out that it was owned by the Hakazar Company. I don't know who else I can talk to. Can you help me?
klisk_station_main.10=Not hostile. Arrogant.
klisk_station_main.27.0=No, we've discussed everything we had to discuss. It's time for me to go.
klisk_station_main.16.0=What, was it all a prank?
klisk_station_main.37.0=Right. So\u2026 where do I go now?
klisk_station_main.26.1=No, of course not. I'll help you.
klisk_station_main.26.0=I'm very busy with other things, Mr Eroloa. I have to decline your proposition.
klisk_station_main.15.0=\u2026.
klisk_station_main.36.0=If it's so easy, why do you need me?
klisk_station_main.25.0=You want me to escort the fleet? The Aurora is no super-heavy cruiser, Mr Eroloa.
klisk_station_main.14.1=No. In fact\u2026 Tell me exactly what you need.
klisk_station_main.14.0=Yes. I'm sorry, but my instructions are clear.
klisk_station_main.35.0=What is the actual mission? Just escort the trade fleet?
klisk_station_main.13.2=I could request information from the ship's database. I need a secure line.
klisk_station_main.24.0=I'm listening.
klisk_station_main.13.1=Okay. I could tell you some things I know personally. I hope it is enough.
klisk_station_main.13.0=Hm. Mr Eroloa. I get it, but I'm not authorized to divulge any information apart from what is said in the package.
klisk_station_main.9=You don't know what the Obliterator is? Well, you'll find out. The Rogues are very religious about it\u2026 kahha!
klisk_station_main.8=Yes\u2026 Or didn't you know? Sixty percent of Borks are complete imbeciles. It's their genetic peculiarity.
klisk_station_main.7=That was a good decision. You can't even imagine how good. The Code says that you have to befriend those seeking friendship and those offering friendship in return. You have to respect those whose friendship gives you profit. And you have to love those who really give you both friendship and profit. The Klisks cooperate with everybody who is not hostile. The Borks, despite the sixty percent factor. The Rogues, despite their Obliterator fanaticism. We would be friends with the Zorsan, but they don't want it themselves. *Eroloa stops talking to take a sip from the glass. It is a perfect time to ask him a question.*
klisk_station_main.6=Kahha! You're familiar with the Code?
klisk_station_main.34.0=That's too bad. In that case, I'm leaving you.
klisk_station_main.5=I've read it\u2026 But why don't you tell me yourself?
klisk_station_main.23.0=In that case, I'm glad that we'll be cooperating from now on.
klisk_station_main.4=Kahha\u2026 *Eroloa drinks.* And how does it benefit the Klisks?
klisk_station_main.12.0=You want more information?
klisk_station_main.3=*While you're taking a chair, Eroloa is distracted by a quiet beeping from a small box. Obviously, it is some kind of communication device.* Yes, it's me. What? He never got here? Well, find a replacement. There isn't one? Hm... I'll think about it. I'm busy. *Eroloa hangs up and turns the little box off.* I see you're seated already. Let's get right to business, I don't like all this... *He waves his hand.*
klisk_station_main.2=Right... *He crawls over to something that looks like a table, closer to you, and you get an opportunity to get a better look at him. Eroloa is very old, which is obvious even to someone who isn't used to Klisks. His sides are pulsing slightly, his antennae are shuddering, and his skin tone is an unpleasent brownish green.* I'll pour myself a drink, excuse me. *Eroloa gets closer to the cupboard and takes out a pitcher and a glass. When he crawls back to the table, his glass is already full.* I'm old, Mr Human Captain. I can allow myself a little faux pas. There are chairs next to the wall. Grab one and take a seat. You will excuse me if I don't offer you a drink, I doubt you'll have it.
klisk_station_main.1=Try not to get distracted by my abode. I know, it must look strange to you... *The Klisk crawls away from the window, leaving a trace of wet sand behind him.* Our planet... it's very hot. Also, sand. There is a lot of sand. It's easy to move on it.
klisk_station_main.98.2=I could request information from the ship's database. I need a secure line.
klisk_station_main.33.1=That's too bad. In that case, I'm leaving you.
klisk_station_main.0=*You walk inside. The office is very yellow, and the floor is very sticky and crunchy. It's because it's covered with sand, and the walls of the office are painted yellow. The Klisk diplomatic representative, Mr Eroloa, is at the opposite wall of the office. He's looking out of the window, almost completely blocking it from view with his enormous body.* Human captain... Kahha. Pleased to meet you.
klisk_station_main.98.1=Okay. I could tell you some things I know personally. I hope it is enough.
klisk_station_main.33.0=But we really need something. After they're done with us, the Zorsan might go to you next.
klisk_station_main.98.0=And still, I can't. I cannot tell you any more.
klisk_station_main.22.0=Are you making fun of me or is that a yes?
klisk_station_main.11.0=\u2026.
klisk_station_main.32.0=Do you need any help?
klisk_station_main.10.2=Well, then, are you going to cooperate with us?
klisk_station_main.10.1=The Rogues' fanaticism? What's the Obliterator?
klisk_station_main.21.0=\u2026.
klisk_station_main.10.0=The Bork factor?
klisk_station_main.31.0=\u2026
klisk_station_main.20.0=I'm proud. I'm glad that we'll be cooperating.
klisk_station_main.30.1=No, we've discussed everything we had to discuss. It's time for me to go.
klisk_station_main.30.0=There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. It won't happen today or tomorrow, we have almost two years... but still. We are at completely different stages of development. My planet needs help, or we will lose.
