henry_about_gardener.99.2=I think he gave some good advice.
henry_about_gardener.99.1=What do you think about that Philosophy of the Path?

henry_about_gardener.8.0=Yes.
henry_about_gardener.8=I'm glad you agree with me. Did you have anything else, Captain? 
henry_about_gardener.7=Standard officer training course. You didn't know, Captain? *Liszkiewicz smiles.* Did you have anything else?
henry_about_gardener.6=To pay a visit to the merchant nearby? Yeah, that's true. I'll order our troops to get ready for a call for action. You never know.
henry_about_gardener.5=I can't say anything. It reminds me a bit of Heraclitus, but I can't remember how exactly. It's been too long since I studied Ancient Greek philosophy. 
henry_about_gardener.1.2=We can't leave our comrades behind.
henry_about_gardener.4=We can't. We have to leave them behind. Because there are over seven billion people on Earth. And there's no one apart from us. If we cease to exist, the won't be an Aurora 3.

henry_about_gardener.1.1=I understand. But still, there are people on it.
henry_about_gardener.3=There are people on Earth, too. And there's more of them there than on the Aurora 1. So that's how it is. Did you have anything else, Captain?
henry_about_gardener.1.0=Of course. You're right. They'd understand, but still, that's a shame.
henry_about_gardener.2=Yes. They'd do the same thing. Do you have anything else? 
henry_about_gardener.99=I'm listening.
henry_about_gardener.1=It's possible. *Henry follows it up right away.* What if he hasn't? Even if he really did contact the Aurora 1, we can't just drop what we're doing and go looking for it. We have a different mission, no less important than that one. We'll have to put off looking for it until later.  
henry_about_gardener.0=Yeah, I heard your conversation.
