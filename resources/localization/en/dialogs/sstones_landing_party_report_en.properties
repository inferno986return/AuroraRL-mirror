sstones_landing_party_report.16.0=\u2026
sstones_landing_party_report.6.3=I think I know what to do.
sstones_landing_party_report.6.2=So what do we do?
sstones_landing_party_report.6.1=Discussing ethics? I thought your love for vivisection would be stronger.
sstones_landing_party_report.6.0=Alive or sentient\u2026 What does it matter? They're just rocks.
sstones_landing_party_report.15.1=Pack up and leave, don't take anything with you.
sstones_landing_party_report.15.0=Take one of the rocks onboard, we'll study it on the ship.
sstones_landing_party_report.5.0=Looks like it\u2026 We need to make a choice: either we bring one of the rocks onboard for analysis or not.
sstones_landing_party_report.9=I'm a scientist, C-Captain. Not a barbarian.
sstones_landing_party_report.8=*Gordon loses his confidence completely and mumbles something about new times, humanism, and compassion.
sstones_landing_party_report.7=I understand, C-Captain, it's not easy to accept a rock as sentient, buuuut... *Gordon stutters and scratches the back of his head absentmindedly.* What if they're sentient and we take one of them? It'll be kidnapping a real personality, a peaceful hum- a creature! That's most... *He screws up his face.* Antiscientific!
sstones_landing_party_report.6=*Gordon opens his mouth to answer but cuts himself off.* They... hm... if they're alive, that's one thing. What if they're sentient? That's another thing entirely. A v-v-very complicated question, C-Captain. Do we dare taking a sentient being from its homeplanet without asking? *He rubs the bridge of his nose.* If it really is sentient, that is.
sstones_landing_party_report.5=Uhhh\u2026 Sapient? Live rocks, C-Captain?
sstones_landing_party_report.4=It's not mustard, it's agar. *Gordon snorts and waves it off.* What's the problem, sir?
sstones_landing_party_report.3=C-Captain? *Gordon looks a bit unkempt, the collar of his shirt is covered in\u2026 is that mustard?*
sstones_landing_party_report.16=Sir, yes, sir. Affirmative. *Click. Apparently, they've already started.*
sstones_landing_party_report.14.0=Landing party, do you copy?
sstones_landing_party_report.2=Sir, yes, sir! We are registering some kind of alpha waves and biorhythms from some rocks. What do we do, Captain? Do we bring one of the rocks onboard?
sstones_landing_party_report.15=Sir?
sstones_landing_party_report.1=Captain, sir\u2026 There is no life on this planet. Not on the surface, not below it. But the scanners have gone haywire! Captain, it seems that they react to stones that way\u2026
sstones_landing_party_report.14=In that case you don't need me, Captain? *Gordon walks away without even turning offhis camera. You can see right away how he chews someone out, waving his hands.*
sstones_landing_party_report.0=Aurora 2, come in! This is the landing party, come in!
sstones_landing_party_report.13=*After thinking it over for a bit, Gordon replies.* This is a good idea, C-Captain. Of course, there are risks... what if the stones turn out to be agressive? But... I think that's a good proposition. *He nods.*
sstones_landing_party_report.4.0=Stones. The soldiers say the scanners register their brain waves and biorhythms. Looks like our ship scanner clocked them too.
sstones_landing_party_report.12=You're the boss. I'm not. *Gordon rubs his nose and lowers his eyes for a couple of seconds.*
sstones_landing_party_report.11=It's that time, C-Captain, where I absolve myself of all responsibility and put it on you. I follow your orders. I'll agree to whatever you say.

sstones_landing_party_report.2.0=It's weird\u2026 I have to contact the Science Department. Wait\u2026 Gordon! Can you hear me?
