klisk_planet_default.22.1=That's too bad. In that case, I'm leaving you.
klisk_planet_default.33.0=No, nothing, no business. It has been good working with you, even though a bit tiring. I have to go.
klisk_planet_default.22.0=But we really need something. After they're done with us, the Zorsan might go to you next.
klisk_planet_default.32.1=A Hakazar Company merchant bot has set up camp on the orbit of my planet. It's giving us trouble. Could you help us make them recall it?  
klisk_planet_default.32.0=No, nothing, no business. It has been good working with you, even though a bit tiring. I have to go.
klisk_planet_default.21.0=Do you need any help?
klisk_planet_default.31.1=I think your help is better than nothing.
klisk_planet_default.31.0=I'll do just that. Thank you, but I don't need your trash.
klisk_planet_default.20.0=\u2026.
klisk_planet_default.30.0=Obsolete weapons? How generous. Am I supposed to thank you?
klisk_planet_default.3=Kahha! *Eroloa clicks approvingly.* Some will call your decision stupid\u2026 But the Code says \"Do not touch the mechanism you did not calibrate.\" You did well, Captain.
klisk_planet_default.2=So how did you sort it out, human captain?
klisk_planet_default.1=*Eroloa coughs loudly.* Kahha! I'm waiting for details.
klisk_planet_default.0=Oh\u2026 Human captain. What brings you here?
klisk_planet_default.36=Of course. *Eroloa clicks affirmatively.* Having a Klisk like me in your debt\u2026 Captain, that's an enviable position. Is there anything else?
klisk_planet_default.35=Good. The bot will leave your orbit soon and won't come back. Is there anything else?
klisk_planet_default.34=Hakazar.. *Eroloa shakes his hand and clicks quietly.* Normally, I'd say no. Hakazar is a very powerful company, ranked higher than Vortang. But, now... I'll try to help you. Of course. But I want to ask you, is that really necessary? It won't be very easy for me. Are you sure there isn't a simpler solution to your problem?
klisk_planet_default.33=Good, then. The systems will be delivered to your ship. Was there anything else?
klisk_planet_default.32=Your call. Is there anything else?
klisk_planet_default.31=*Eroloa shakes his head.* It's obsolete by our standards... Kahha! Ahem. And secondly, they're battleship systems, they're very powerful. You could use them to organize fixed-site protection. And the third thing is, the Code doesn't forbid gifting things you yourself don't need. The fourth thing is, if you don't need them, you don't have to take them.
klisk_planet_default.30=Department of Recycling? Eroloa. Glad to hear you. *He grunts.* As far as I know, the obsolete battleship weapon systems haven't been destroyed yet. They haven't? Great. Ready them for transportation. The most powerful ones. Thank you. *He hangs up.* There you go.
klisk_planet_default.29=I'm considering it... Kahha! I can't send you any troops. It'll be considered an intervention, and the Klisks are always neutral. I can't send you our newest weapons, since I can't do it for free. The Code forbids it. But... *Eroloa crawls over to the phone and makes a call.* Yes. This is Eroloa. Connect me with the Department of Recycling.
klisk_planet_default.28=The Zorsan? *Eroloa clicks nervously.* I'm not surprised, but how did you let that happen? You know what\u2026 don't tell me. It's a bad situation.
klisk_planet_default.27=*Eroloa listens attentively.*
klisk_planet_default.26=Absolutely. You\u2026 Kahha! You handled yourself very well. Was it luck or a well-calculated plan? Doesn't matter. I'm happy it turned out like this.
klisk_planet_default.25=*Eroloa reads the cargo manifest. He clicks in surprise.* Human captain, I couldn't have done the deal better myself\u2026
klisk_planet_default.24=*Eroloa reads the cargo manifest attentively, then puts it aside, clicking with relief.* You were already getting me worried... but you did the right thing for a foreigner. It's not ideal, but we got off easy enough.
klisk_planet_default.23=*Eroloa smiles.* They won't. Captain, don't waste my time.
klisk_planet_default.22=*He shakes his head no and coughs.* No. I'm not talking about helping me\u2026 Kahha! Although I'll say no to that, too. We cannot help you, human captain. I'm sorry.
klisk_planet_default.21=*He is still coughing.*
klisk_planet_default.20=*Eroloa thinks for a while. He empties his glass in one swig and coughs for a long time.*
klisk_planet_default.3.0=I think so, too.
klisk_planet_default.19=Was there anything else?
klisk_planet_default.18=Try to buy what he's selling, he'll leave then.
klisk_planet_default.17=Oh. Too bad\u2026 Kahha! Too bad\u2026 I cannot help you. *You can see great pain in Eroloa's face.* I am an official employee of the Vortangu Company. I am not allowed to meddle with Hakazar's affairs.
klisk_planet_default.16=What do you want?
klisk_planet_default.15=Captain... We're bound by the Code. It says that exchanging things for themselves isn't stupid. All our deals are of great scale, they have multiple stages and are systematic. And you ruined one of those great systems... *Eroloa sighs.* You brought us a small, here-and-now profit, but you deprived us of potentially incredible gains. Congratulations.
klisk_planet_default.2.1=Well\u2026 I allowed myself to carry out the deal. Is that a bad thing?
klisk_planet_default.14=*Eroloa reads your cargo manifest and his color changes very noticeably. Then he starts clicking rapidly and irritatedly.* Human captain... Do you understand that you... *He grunts quietly and gets angry.* You... You ruined it all.
klisk_planet_default.2.0=I didn't. I don't like putting my nose where it doesn't belong, so I just guarded the cargo until Dlorou got better. That is why we're late.
klisk_planet_default.13=*Eroloa tenses up suddenly, but he's in control of himself.* Right\u2026 Now that's interesting. So tell me, human captain, how did you do it?
klisk_planet_default.1.0=Everything is good. Apart from the fact that the captain of the main transport ship suddenly got sick, and that almost sabotaged the deal.
klisk_planet_default.0.5=A courtesy visit. I see you're busy. I'm leaving already.
klisk_planet_default.0.4=I'm back. The trade fleet is safe and sound.
klisk_planet_default.0.3=We wish to trade
klisk_planet_default.0.2=We have to talk about something.
klisk_planet_default.0.1=About those klisk mutants\u2026
klisk_planet_default.0.0=We have to talk about something.
klisk_planet_default.19.1=No, we've already discussed everything I wanted to discuss. It's time for me to go.
klisk_planet_default.19.0=There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. It won't happen today or tomorrow, we have almost two years... but still. We are at completely different stages of development. My planet needs help, or we will lose.
klisk_planet_default.29.0=\u2026.
klisk_planet_default.18.0=Hm.
klisk_planet_default.28.0=And what is your decision?
klisk_planet_default.17.0=So what do I do?
klisk_planet_default.27.3=No, nothing, no business. It has been good working with you, even though a bit tiring. I have to go.
klisk_planet_default.27.2=A Hakazar Company merchant bot has set up camp on the orbit of my planet. It's giving us trouble. Could you help us make them recall it?  
klisk_planet_default.16.3=There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. It won't happen today or tomorrow, we have almost two years... but still. We are at completely different stages of development. My planet needs help, or we will lose.
klisk_planet_default.27.1=We have an unusual alien on board\u2026
klisk_planet_default.16.2=Yeah, there is something. Recently, a trade bot has come to my planet's orbit, and it's ruining all of our communications. I found out that it was owned by the Hakazar Company. I don't know who else I can talk to. Can you help me?
klisk_planet_default.27.0=The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. We have almost two years, which gives us a chance\u2026 but we won't be able to repel their attack alone. We could use some help.
klisk_planet_default.16.1=We have an unusual alien on board\u2026
klisk_planet_default.16.0=No, I've already discussed everything I wanted to discuss. It's time for me to go.
klisk_planet_default.26.0=I'm happy, too. You know, I have a few things I want to discuss with you.
klisk_planet_default.15.0=I'm very sorry.
klisk_planet_default.36.0=No, nothing. I don't have any more business. I have to go.
klisk_planet_default.25.0=Is that a compliment?
klisk_planet_default.14.0=But I exchanged your goods and made a profit! What's so bad about it?
klisk_planet_default.35.0=My business is done. I have to go.
klisk_planet_default.13.2=I made a profitable deal, Mr Eroloa.
klisk_planet_default.24.0=Too bad I made a mistake somewhere.
klisk_planet_default.13.1=I did it according to the Code. I think I did it right.
klisk_planet_default.13.0=Well, I tried not to bite more than I could chew. I traded it all for money without trying to get fancy with the exchange.
klisk_planet_default.34.1=Alas, there is no choice.
klisk_planet_default.34.0=Hm\u2026 I changed my mind. I better sort it out myself. But remember, you owe me one.
klisk_planet_default.23.0=That's too bad. In that case, I'm leaving you.
klisk_planet_default.33.1=A Hakazar Company merchant bot has set up camp on the orbit of my planet. It's giving us trouble. Could you help us make them recall it?
