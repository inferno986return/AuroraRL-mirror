rogues_admiral_default.0.7=No, I didn't want anything. Just a courtesy visit.
rogues_admiral_default.0.6=There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. In two years, but still, we can't defend ourselves alone. We need your support.
rogues_admiral_default.0.5=We are ready to pay the fine.
rogues_admiral_default.0.4=I have some Rogues with me. They were in a crash, I saved them.
rogues_admiral_default.25.1=My planet can't wait. I'm sorry, but I'll have to ask you to recall him.
rogues_admiral_default.0.3=One of your ships is going to crash. The situation is dire.
rogues_admiral_default.25.0=Is that so? In that case, I really do think I'd better handle it myself.
rogues_admiral_default.0.2=Our crew is infected by a deadly disease! Can you help us?
rogues_admiral_default.0.1=Yes, there is something. A small group of Rogues is going to pray on my planet's satellite. It causes natural catastrophes on our planet. Your compatriots won't leave. The leader said I could provide them with everything necessary and speed up the process, but your order would convince them, too.
rogues_admiral_default.207.0=I see.
rogues_admiral_default.0.0=I managed to obtain the necessary data. I didn't risk transferring it, I took it here on the source drive.
rogues_admiral_default.207=Unlikely. Our species are too different, our medicine will not help you. You should pobably ask Klisk, as they know much about other lifeforms.
rogues_admiral_default.6=*Hoor doesn't pay any attention to your question.* Was there anything else?
rogues_admiral_default.206=*Hoor's face softens. But he is still frowning.* Five credits. No\u2026 more.
rogues_admiral_default.5=\"*Hoor is shaking, but every next twitch is weaker than the one before it. In the end, he blinks and looks at you with his slightly cloudy, but intelligent eyes
rogues_admiral_default.205=*The mysterious machine stops beeping. Hoor's face jerks.* You\u2026 yes\u2026 saved\u2026 *Hoor frowns.* What do you want in return?
rogues_admiral_default.4=*Hoor plays with the drive, then finds the correct port in the machine by touch and inserts the device. He is silent for a couple of minutes, with his eyes closed. When he opens them, Hoor speaks.* We... didn't expect that. We didn't. But the data speaks for itself. But there is little of it. *Apparently, Hoor isn't talking to you.* But they... no. There have been precedents. We cannot afford another incident with another Horshak... And if... *Hoor twitches.* No! No! No!! No!!!
rogues_admiral_default.204=*Hoor doesn't answer. Apparently, he doesn't intend to, either.*
rogues_admiral_default.100.1=I think we'll pay another time.
rogues_admiral_default.3=*The machine stops humming, Hoor smiles.* And? *It's pointless to ask him again.*
rogues_admiral_default.203=Help is on its way. You\u2026 will be rewarded.
rogues_admiral_default.100.0=Here you go.
rogues_admiral_default.29=And I'll minimize the risk of another conflict with a powerful enemy.
rogues_admiral_default.2=*Hoor plays with the drive, then finds the correct port in the machine by touch and inserts the device. He is silent for a couple of minutes, with his eyes closed. When he opens them, Hoor speaks.* I regret it, but there is no danger of their attacking us. We cannot help you, human captain.
rogues_admiral_default.202=Mistrust\u2026 Refusal\u2026 *Hoor closes his eyes, the machine stops blinking and beeping. The Rogue breathes, but doesn't react to any stimuli. You better visit him another time.*
rogues_admiral_default.1=*Hoor's eyes become clearer. The machine hums louder. He extends his hand to you.*
rogues_admiral_default.28=*The machine barely hums. Hoor answers after a while.* No. We cannot afford a new conflict with the Zorsan.
rogues_admiral_default.201=By the Devourer, do I look like a Bork? First the data, then the money.
rogues_admiral_default.0=*Hoor looks at you, his eyes cloudy. The machine hums and blinks.* Oh\u2026 you. What do you want?
rogues_admiral_default.27=I'll send a courier to him. Is there anything else?
rogues_admiral_default.206.0=Well, that's better than nothing. Happy to be working with you. Good luck.
rogues_admiral_default.200=*The machine bleeps, Hoor speaks quietly.* Coordinates?
rogues_admiral_default.26=Good decision\u2026 Is there anything else?
rogues_admiral_default.25=*Hoor answers surprisingly quickly.* They are doing mass. Their leader is getting ready to walk the path of an Elder. It is a very important thing for him. If I delay his mass... he won't be able to do another one for a very long time. If you helped him... that would make him very grateful to you. A future Elder being grateful to you...
rogues_admiral_default.205.1=I like the way you think! I wouldn't say no to money.
rogues_admiral_default.205.0=In return? No, thank you. I just saved your compatriots.
rogues_admiral_default.100=Great. You have to pay ${rogues.fine} credits.
rogues_admiral_default.6.0=No, I didn't want anything. We've discussed everything I wanted. I have to go.
rogues_admiral_default.204.0=\u2026
rogues_admiral_default.5.0=That's good. Are you sure you're okay?
rogues_admiral_default.203.0=How big is the reward?
rogues_admiral_default.34.0=Of course. Let's see if we can find something.
rogues_admiral_default.29.0=Has it crossed your mind that a conflict is inevitable? When they're done with us, the Zorsan may attack you.
rogues_admiral_default.4.0=Elder Hoor?!
rogues_admiral_default.202.0=\u2026
rogues_admiral_default.33.0=Wow. Is there anything else you want to add?
rogues_admiral_default.28.0=But listen, if you don't help us, you'll lose a potentially profitable cooperation!
rogues_admiral_default.3.0=Okay. That's too bad.
rogues_admiral_default.201.1=Uh, no. First the money, then the data.
rogues_admiral_default.201.0=Damn it. Okay. I'm transferring it.
rogues_admiral_default.32.1=I could do it, but how? \"Getting information\" is too simple of an expression for this case.
rogues_admiral_default.32.0=We already have the information.
rogues_admiral_default.27.1=There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. In two years, but still, we can't defend ourselves alone. We need your support.
rogues_admiral_default.27.0=No, there isn't. Our business is concluded. I have to go.
rogues_admiral_default.2.1=Okay. That's too bad.
rogues_admiral_default.2.0=But\u2026 We risked so much getting that data!
rogues_admiral_default.200.1=Wait. I'd like a reward for my help.
rogues_admiral_default.200.0=They are being transferred.
rogues_admiral_default.34=In case you fail, we will deny everything.
rogues_admiral_default.33=Zorsan objects have it. Ships. The important thing is, if the information goes missing and the objects potentially get damaged, it may provoke them to attack sooner. Also, if the information does not contain any data that proves that there is a chance of their attacking us, we will have to decline.
rogues_admiral_default.32=*Finally, he answers. He speaks very slowly.* Chance... Possibility... There is one. Not enough data. We need more. If you want our final decision, you have to obtain it.
rogues_admiral_default.31=*Hoor opens his mouth, but then closes it instantly. The machine starts humming, boiling, and blinking. It goes on for a good five minutes. Hoor is shaking rather noticeably. His red suit is trembling on his stomach from his strong pulse.*
rogues_admiral_default.31.0=\u2026
rogues_admiral_default.26.1=There is something very important. The Zorsan are going to attack my planet. In two years, but still, we can't defend ourselves alone. We need your support.
rogues_admiral_default.26.0=No, there isn't. Our business is concluded. I have to go.
rogues_admiral_default.1.1=Here you go.
rogues_admiral_default.1.0=Here you go.
