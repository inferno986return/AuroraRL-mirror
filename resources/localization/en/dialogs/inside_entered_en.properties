inside_entered.3=I d-d-d-don't know, Captain. *It looks like he doesn't like the look on your face, because he quickly adds\u2026* Captain, don't! I... it's my fault! But\u2026
inside_entered.2=*Gordon looks away, apparently to check some data, and then speaks. He is confident, although he is probably scared.* We're in another world, Captain. There.
inside_entered.1=Y-yes.
inside_entered.3.0=Enough. I'm not going to blame you for it. In any case, I'm the Captain and the responsibility is on me. Gordon, I don't know how, but we have to get out of here. What do you know about this place?
inside_entered.0=*Gordon is white as a sheet.*
inside_entered.5.0=What?
inside_entered.7.0=Got it. Calm down your coworker. And when he comes to, tell him that we're taking a fine out of his next paycheck. Is that all? 
inside_entered.10.0=In that case, over and out. Make a report if anything happens.
inside_entered.9.0=I don't understand anything, but okay. Is that all? 
inside_entered.0.0=Gordon. Trust me, I'm calm and not angry. Do you believe me?
inside_entered.2.0=Good. Now tell me how to get out of here. 
inside_entered.10=*Gordon nods.*
inside_entered.6.0=It's\u2026 it's impossible. It's scientifically impossible!
inside_entered.8.0=What do you mean, differently? I don't feel anything different. I can't see a Me From The Future.
inside_entered.9=I can't explain anything\u2026 B-but you better prepare yourself for our physics laws having n-no effect on the inhabitants of this world!
inside_entered.8=No, Captain. This world has\u2026 curious laws of physics. W-we'll study it some more, but it seems that\u2026 That here, even time flows differently. 
inside_entered.7=*You hear a mad scream from behind Gordon's back.* SHOVE YOUR SCIENCE WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE! *The one screaming this - a respectable-looking frail old man - drops to the floor and has a breakdown. Gordon is embarrassed.* Well... it's a different world... everything is different. Captain, we need time to study it. Try to investigate the terrain and the situation. 
inside_entered.1.0=But if you don't explain where we are, I'll start getting angry. Explain it in layman's terms.
inside_entered.6=Apparently, this liquid\u2026 It's\u2026 It's alive. *Gordon adds after a moment.* We're in a universe that is a living organism, Captain.
inside_entered.5=In essence... *Gordon rubs the bridge of his nose and turns to look at the data again.* Yes... In essence, we aren't in space. I mean, we're not in a vacuum. The Aurora 2 is inside an organic liquid of unknown composition. We cannot study its composition yet. But it does contain some simple proteins. That's all we've managed to find out. And... Yeah... Another thing...
