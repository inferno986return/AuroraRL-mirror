zorsan_battle_first_dropship.3.1=Right, you give them hell on the surface, and we'll give them hell in space and see that they don't reach you.
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.3.0=I have some more questions.
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.0.2=Do you think you can handle it?
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.3=I don't know. Even considering that their dropships are goddamn huge and carry lots of troops, it's still a mere handful compared to the population of Earth and the size of our armies. And there is no way they don't understand it. That means they have some kind of ace up their sleeve, and I don't like it one bit.
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.0.1=Can I help somehow?
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.2=Several small dropships have attacked the ICS and managed to get a boarding party onboard. To be honest, no one expected that. There are almost no soldiers onboard, so if you don't help them, the Zorsan will take it easily. And without its weapons, Earth defenses will lose a signifact part of its firepower. So if you can, send some of your people to deal with the attack.
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.0.0=Where did they land?
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.1=Mostly in Europe, the densely populated areas. We can't use WMD's there, so we'll have to do it with conventional weapons.
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.0=The first alien carrier ship has reached Earth's orbit and launched multiple smaller dropships. The first of them have already reached the surface, they're very fast and manoeuvrable, out AA guns and interceptors can't shoot them down effectively.
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.1.1=Got it.
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.1.0=I have some more questions.
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.2.2=I don't think I can help, I don't have that many people.
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.2.1=All right, I'll try to help.
zorsan_battle_first_dropship.2.0=I have some more questions.
