inside_first_damage.4.1=Right. And what about\u2026
inside_first_damage.4.0=Can you try to slap together something more powerful?
inside_first_damage.6.1=Okay, let's take care of it. Over and out.
inside_first_damage.6.0=Right. And what about\u2026
inside_first_damage.6=I doubt it. First we'll have to study the space around us well, and we don't have time! We have to get out of here now!
inside_first_damage.5=Exactly! And that's our hope! This \"organism's\" immune system should try to rid itself of us if it can't destroy us! I've had experience with this, before Project Aurora.
inside_first_damage.1.0=Hm\u2026 Tell me\u2026
inside_first_damage.4=Exactly, Cap. It's a good thing our weapons work in here.
inside_first_damage.3=We tried to hail them, but they don't respond. If they really are something like \"cells\" of a living organism, they won't: they aren't sapient.
inside_first_damage.2=*Yes?*
inside_first_damage.1=It looks like some kind of defense mechanism! Something like\u2026 white blood cells! They detect a threat to the organism in us and try to destroy us!
inside_first_damage.3.1=Okay, let's take care of it. Over and out.
inside_first_damage.0=Captain, this thing just blew up next to us and damaged the outer hull badly!
inside_first_damage.3.0=Right. And what about\u2026
inside_first_damage.5.1=Okay, let's take care of it. Over and out.
inside_first_damage.5.0=Right. And what about\u2026
inside_first_damage.0.0=What the hell was that? Gordon, what do you say?
inside_first_damage.2.2=So we're basically space flu, then?
inside_first_damage.2.1=So we'll have to keep destroying them before they destroy us. 
inside_first_damage.2.0=As I understand, trying to reason with them is pointless? 
inside_first_damage.4.2=Okay, let's take care of it. Over and out.
