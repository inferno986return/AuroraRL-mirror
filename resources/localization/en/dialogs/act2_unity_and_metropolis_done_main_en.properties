act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.19=Hah. You promised\u2026 Well, then. *Martan smirks, then pulls the most emotionless face he can and says:* \"At the moment, we cannot afford to raise the budget.\" Tell him this.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.18=Bad. Merchants who have contracts with Project Aurora were selling surplusses. Right now we can't afford private traders working with the aliens... You couldn't do it, that's very bad. Go on with your report.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.17=Look, do you realize how important that is? Congratulations. In the next few years, we'll be getting less money, and the responsibility for that is on... *Martan spreads out his hands and brings them together theatrically, pointing at you.* And that's not even mentioning the problems that await the entire project. Report on.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.16=Bad. *Martan is frowning and speaking briskly, indicating his lowered spirits.* We thought he'd listen to you, at least... Damn it! How could you mess it up? Okay... enough. What else?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.21.0=Are you serious?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.15=Good. There will be less resources leaking out of the colony now. Of course, you probably had to hold Donahue at gunpoint... *Martan smiles.* However, he doesn't understand himself that we can't afford selling processed goods right now.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.14=I'm glad you managed to talk him into it. No one could do it until you did... Before he left for the colony, Rich Donahue was more loyal. *Martan sighs.* If it goes on like that, we'll have to replace him.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.13=All right, I'll pass it on. Project Aurora will have even more resources coming in now. We really need them right now.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.12=I'm listening. You know what they want to hear upstairs. *Martan stares at you without blinking.* If they don't hear what they want, you need to have an excuse.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.11=I see. Good job. *Martan smiles, then continues in his usual voice.* It's a good thing that you paid him a visit. He may be a professional, but being in charge at a place like that means a lot of pressure. Don't forget to visit him regularly. He'll probably have some valuable data, or you'll be able to help him somehow. You understand, sometimes you have to put some physical pressure on in a deniable way. Right! *Martat intertwines his fingers and cracks them loudly.* We're done with the ambassadors. What else was there?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.10=Data is good. But... it was too easy getting it, wasn't it? I don't think it's going to be a walk in the park. You better get ready. *Martan speaks firmly, but a little nervously.* If you aren't sure you're ready for everything, better postpone that trip. What else?

act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.9=Exactly. *Martan nods.* They're an obvious enemy, even honest in a way, dealing with them is very simple. With the other races, like Klisks or the Rogues, it's much more complicated. What else?

act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.13.1=The embargo on trade with the aliens is continued, just like you ordered me.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.6=What was the job abotu? *After you finish, Martan squints again, annoyed.* Why did you say yes? This job stinks of something fishy and of ammonia from a mile away. Although, decisions like that are why we gave you the carte blanche. You know what you're doing. Maybe you can see something that I can't.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.13.0=Donahue signed the order about raising the tariffs.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.5=What was the job? *Martan listens and nods, approving of your choice.* Good. You shouldn't risk it, too much is at stake.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.4=So what? *Your boss looks at you lazily and sceptically.* First, it could have been a montage of some sort, have you thought about it? Second, even if the Gardener can really... *Martan squints, annoyed, and wiggles his fingers in the air* SEE THE FUTURE, then he hasn't used it to help us or anybody else yet. That's not what we should be thinking about right now. What about the ambassadors?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.3=*Martan listens to your tale attentively. It turns out very long, you can't just summarize it. Sometimes he interrupts you.* So they allowed us to have our little fisticuffs and promised not to involve themselves? Very noble. I'm sure that if we begin to win, they'll start to help the Zorsan. And if they start to win, they'll help us... great. What happened next? *And he listens to you again. All you have left to do is tell him. By the end you're surprised, since Martan doesn't seem fazed at all by what the Gardener did. Martan nods and reclines in his chair, stretching his neck in side-to-side movements.*
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.2=And?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.1=*Martan sits in his chair.* Exactly. The space explorer's burden, how could you not have it? Huh? Okay. I understand it you're done with your objectives. Report.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.0=*No matter how much of a hero and a celebrity you are, you can't get through to Martan. How does it feel, waiting in line for the first time in years? Admit it, it feels peculiar. Finally, you are let through. Martan is already waiting. As always, he's wearing his shirt and vest, without a jacket. As always, he smells of the same cologne. If it wasn't for the wrinkles and some more gray in his hair, it's as if he hasn't changed at all, as if the years never happened.* There you are. *Martan extends his hand.* If someone else had gone instead, we'd be worried by now. But you were handling the Aurora. Everybody knew you'd be back.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.11.1=That's it.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.11.0=About the colony?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.25.11=I think we're done with this\u2026 Look, why bother with the signatures? Project Aurora can just order him to comply and be done with it.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.25.10=The colony is a very harsh place. People have it hard there. Project Aurora is trying to milk them dry.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.30=Reasearch craft with a possible modification into a military one. So yeah. If it comes to that, you're going to war. *Martan smiles.* But we don't need that for now, we don't want you to do anything like that so far. The command wants your help with recon. Just go to a certain place and scan a few planets. You don't even have to engage in combat, should anything happen. The important thing is that you hurry. It's very important.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.14.10=I think we're done with this\u2026 Look, why bother with the signatures? Project Aurora can just order him to comply and be done with it.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.29=Good. You're dismissed for now. *After a small pause, Martan adds.* Relatively speaking. You still have to try to find out something about the Obliterator. And the Zorsan, of course\u2026
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.28=Done. I'll relay your reports upstairs\u2026 Is there anything else?                                             \u00D0\u00E0\u00E7\u00EE\u00E1\u00F0\u00E0\u00EB\u00E8\u00F1\u00FC. \u00DF \u00EF\u00E5\u00F0\u00E5\u00E4\u00E0\u00EC \u00EE\u00F2\u00F7\u00B8\u00F2\u00FB \u00ED\u00E0\u00E2\u00E5\u00F0\u00F5? \u00D3 \u00ED\u00E0\u00F1 \u00F7\u00F2\u00EE-\u00F2\u00EE \u00E5\u00F9\u00B8?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.27=Those people agreed to come there themselves. That's their duty. And if they're unhappy, that's their problem. They knew what they were doing, didn't they? *That's a solid argument. However, Martan's voice warms a little.* I know, buddy. You're worried. It's all right. The top brass of the Aurora Project aren't sadists or tyrants. Trust me, as soon as we deal with at least one of the threats, we'll cool it with the colony. But right now, there's no other way.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.26=Because Project Aurora needs it. *Martan's voice becomes very acidic, he's speaking mockingly, sarcastically.* Because in case you haven't noticed, there's an energy crisis on this planet. And some space empire wants to go to war with us. Not to mention there's some giant spaceship, a chtonic thing, wants to destroy our sun. Really, where do we get off taking resources from the place we came to take resources from?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.25=Really? I'll report about it upstairs. Interesting information.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.27.9=I don't know if this is important\u2026 some of the soldiers serving at the colony are augmented. Did you know about it?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.24=Augmented? What, at the colony? *Your boss frowns and looks something up on his tablet.* Weird. No one sent any systems like that there. So far it's a secret prototype.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.27.8=Did you know colonists trade with the aliens anyway?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.23=Of course. There was always going to be smuggling in a place that's so far away from the home country. It's a problem, sure, but Project Aurora is still ready to put up with it for now. Believe me, as soon as we deal with the Zorsan and the Obliterator... *Martan shakes his head.* Those scum will have no place at the colony.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.29.0=I don't get it, are you trying to send me to war? The Aurora 2 is a research craft.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.27.7=Do you want my opinion off the record? They don't really like us there. Some local activist tried to throw a piece of clay caked in blood at me!
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.22=If he did, I'd buy you a new uniform personally. Haha! Just kidding. They'd issue it to you for free. Why do you waste time thinking about such nonsense?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.27.6=Look, I promised Donahue I'd find out\u2026 why do you deny his requests? Requests for increasing medical and military budgets were denied. What's the matter?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.21=Really? What can you do\u2026 He didn't hit you, though.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.27.5=There's an embargo on  trade with the aliens\u2026 but Rich refused to continue it.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.20=For yourself? I'd tell you that for Project Aurora, as of right now, it's bad business to let the colony grow. Limiting the financing is part of the overall strategy for freezing its growth. Donahue understands it himself, if he's not stupid. He definitely does. But then why did he ask you about it?.. *Martan shakes his head abruptly.* Let's talk about it some other time. We have things left to discuss.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.27.4=I couldn't do it with the tariffs. I couldn't talk him into it.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.27.3=The secretary refused to sign it. The taxes weren't raised.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.27.2=The embargo on trade with the aliens is continued, just like you ordered me.
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.25.9=I don't know if this is important\u2026 some of the soldiers serving at the colony are augmented. Did you know about it?
act2_unity_and_metropolis_done_main.27.1=Donahue signed the order about raising the tariffs.
