bork_embassy_test.19.0=Okay. If you're getting up to do what I think you want to do, you better sit back down. 
bork_embassy_test.29.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test.18.0=Look, it's not my fault. This is how it is. I'm on an important assignment.
bork_embassy_test.39.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test.17.2=*Keep silent*
bork_embassy_test.28.0=Stupid? Why? I never said anything like that.
bork_embassy_test.9.3=Maybe we should get to business already.
bork_embassy_test.17.1=I don't know. He said so, but\u2026 he says a lot of things. And thinks a lot of things. You go first, if you want. I don't care. 
bork_embassy_test.9.2=We saw a fight, and the local law enforcer just stood there and didn't do anything. Why? 
bork_embassy_test.17.0=Well, that's what he said. So yeah, me.
bork_embassy_test.9.1=It's a beautiful city. Why are there so few tall buildings?
bork_embassy_test.9.0=Shorter. Is that what the city is called?
bork_embassy_test.29=Don't try to fool me!
bork_embassy_test.38.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test.28=*The Bork gets up.* Hey! Don't you act like I'm stupid!
bork_embassy_test.27=*The Bork looks at you as if his his brains just got overloaded.* Wha-? 
bork_embassy_test.27.0=I don't know who's going first. Let's wait for him and see. You want to go first? If it's so important, I'm okay with it. 
bork_embassy_test.16.1=*Sit down on the other couch*
bork_embassy_test.26=*The Bork doesn't listen to you. He roars and charges you, stamping his feet loudly. You can't see anything in his stupid eyes. Danger. No time to ask for help. Time to act.* 
bork_embassy_test.16.0=Henry, let's sit down on the other couch.
bork_embassy_test.25=Keep alert and don't give in to provocations. But should anything happen, don't hesitate to act. *Meanwhile, the Bork keeps getting angrier.*
bork_embassy_test.24=If a Bork wants to attack you, he punches you in the mug, no foreplay. If he doesn't want to, he doesn't. And he just\u2026 *he shrugs meaningfully.* 
bork_embassy_test.8.0=You're talking about it like\u2026 As if it were nothing. 
bork_embassy_test.26.2=*Dodge the blow*
bork_embassy_test.23=Captain, I understand Borks pretty well\u2026 He's acting a bit\u2026 stupid. As if he's trying to provoke a conflict. 
bork_embassy_test.37.0=Okay, well\u2026 Please, don't be angry. We don't know your customs, so we could have offended you somehow. 
bork_embassy_test.26.1=*Wound the Bork*
bork_embassy_test.22=*Having gotten up from the sofa, the Bork keeps raging and waving his hands around, and the tone of his voice keeps rising. He paces back and forth and speaks, not very intelligibly, but fiercely.* There! You sit here, and then these people come! And call me stupid! 
bork_embassy_test.26.0=*Kill the Bork*
bork_embassy_test.15.1=All right. But I'm taking my second-in-command with me. Worst case scenario, he waits on the couch outside. 
bork_embassy_test.21=What?! Smartass! You calling me dumb?!
bork_embassy_test.15.0=All right, I get it. Guys, have fun. And use condoms, should anything happen. 
bork_embassy_test.7.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test.36.0=What if I can't?
bork_embassy_test.14.2=I'm not afraid. Guys, stay here. Henry, follow me. You can wait on the couch outside the office.
bork_embassy_test.25.0=All right, let me try for the last time. Listen! Enough. Let's talk. 
bork_embassy_test.14.1=I'm not afraid. Guys, stay here.
bork_embassy_test.6.3=Maybe we should get to business already.
bork_embassy_test.14.0=I'm not pardonning you, and I'm not. I'm cautious.
bork_embassy_test.6.2=We saw the obelisk honoring your victory over the Zorsan.
bork_embassy_test.6.1=It's a beautiful city. Why are there so few tall buildings?
bork_embassy_test.6.0=Shorter. Is that what the city is called?
bork_embassy_test.35.1=Henry, we have to do something about him.
bork_embassy_test.35.0=I don't want any trouble. Let's just talk. Calm down, please. 
bork_embassy_test.24.0=And do you propose we do?
bork_embassy_test.13.0=Is that really necessary?
bork_embassy_test.5.0=Actually, they had knives. But your cop only got involved when one of the fighter lost consciousness.
bork_embassy_test.34.1=I don't want any trouble. Calm down.
bork_embassy_test.34.0=*Keep silent*
bork_embassy_test.4.3=Maybe we should get to business already.
bork_embassy_test.23.0=What do you mean?
bork_embassy_test.4.2=Obviously, it has to do with the obelisk we saw? The one honoring your victory over the Zorsan. 
bork_embassy_test.12.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test.4.1=We saw a fight, and the local law enforcer just stood there and didn't do anything. Why? 
bork_embassy_test.4.0=Shorter. Is that what the city is called?
bork_embassy_test.33.0=*Keep silent, trying not to pay him any attention*
bork_embassy_test.19=Me too! Very important! *The Bork wheezes loudly and gets up from the sofa.* 
bork_embassy_test.22.1=Henry, what are you going to say now?
bork_embassy_test.18=*The Bork flinches.* I sit here an hour, two, three! And you go first?!
bork_embassy_test.3.3=Maybe we should get to business already.
bork_embassy_test.22.0=Shut up and sit back down!
bork_embassy_test.17=*The bork keeps silent for a couple more minutes, breathing with concentration and making sense of what he just saw. Then he turns his head lazily.* What? Ahead of the line? You? 
bork_embassy_test.3.2=We saw the obelisk honoring your victory over the Zorsan.
bork_embassy_test.11.0=What can you do? Business first, leisure later.
bork_embassy_test.16=*Then you walk down corridors full of carved wood decorations. The atmosphere here is mellow and completely un-Borkish. You turn left, then a couple times more, and then you're standing in front of yet another door. Unlike the one before it, it's wooden and unmarked. There is a couch on each side of it. A typical Bork is in one of them, looking irritated and menacing. The holster on his hip makes him look even more impressive. Your escort shrugs.* Oh. As you can see, the Diplomatic Representative is busy. Don't worry, as soon as he's finished, you are coming in, ahead of the line. I'll call you. *The escort goes inside the door.* 
bork_embassy_test.3.1=We saw a fight, and the local law enforcer just stood there and didn't do anything. Why? 
bork_embassy_test.15=What can you do? We aren't allowed to invite so many people into Mr Diplomatic Representative's waiting room. *He taunts you again.* 
bork_embassy_test.3.0=It's a beautiful city. Why are there so few tall buildings?
bork_embassy_test.43.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test.14=Pardon me, are you afraid? *The Bork roars tauntingly*
bork_embassy_test.32.0=All right. I'll try this for the last time. Hey, buddy, sorry if I offended you. If you want to go first, go first, I don't care. 
bork_embassy_test.13=*After some time the escort stops next to a small metal door, behind which you can hear music, Borks roaring and Klisks clicking.* Our canteen is there. Let your people rest there, you will be talking with Mr Diplomatic Representative one-on-one, anyway.
bork_embassy_test.2.4=Maybe we should get to business already.
bork_embassy_test.12=*The interior can be caled simple. Everything looks rich, but rough,from soft sofas to the chandeliers. But it doesn't offend the eye: the designer had taste.* 
bork_embassy_test.2.3=We saw the obelisk honoring your victory over the Zorsan.
bork_embassy_test.21.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test.11=*The Bork looks very salf-satisfied.* Consider it a family secret. *Then he sighs.* Too bad you didn't take the opportunity to see the city. It's considered beautiful.
bork_embassy_test.2.2=We saw a fight, and the local law enforcer just stood there and didn't do anything. Why? 
bork_embassy_test.10.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test.10=Right. Business. Follow me, please. *He entres the building.* 
bork_embassy_test.2.1=It's a beautiful city. Why are there so few tall buildings?
bork_embassy_test.2.0=Shorter. Is that what the city is called?
bork_embassy_test.42.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test.31.0=That's pretty obvious. What else?
bork_embassy_test.1.1=How come you're here? We hurried here straight away.
bork_embassy_test.1.0=Heh, that was quick.
bork_embassy_test.41.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test.30.1=Henry, it's time for your priceless advice.
bork_embassy_test.30.0=I'm sorry if something's the matter. Again, if you want to go first, go. What do I care? 
bork_embassy_test.0.0=Thanks for the lift.
bork_embassy_test.40.0=\u2026
bork_embassy_test.9=Well, what can you do. We don't like death, but we don't mourn for long either.
bork_embassy_test.8=*The Bork finishes laughing and continues.* At one time, we were at war with the Zorsan. Thirty years ago. They occupied Shipshiar and landed their troops here. They took most of the city. Then we kicked them out and destroyed them. They used WMD's, the city was no more. *Bork talks about in an everyday lazy voice. Even taking his alien way of showing emotions into account, it is obvious that he doesn't feel sorry about it at all.*
bork_embassy_test.7=Obelisk? Victory? Did the driver tell you all that? *The Bork laughs. More accurately, he lets out a dull roar, blinks and pats his sides, but the essence of these actions could be logically explained as laughter.* He lied to you. 
bork_embassy_test.6=A cop?.. Hm. I understand what you're trying to say. Yes. What can you do? Borks are sturdy creatures.Trying to punch each other's lights out with our fists really won't work. So no one really gives us any mind if the fight involves makeshift weapons. Until it becomes a murder.
bork_embassy_test.5=Oh... That has to do with our culture. As you may have noticed, the Borks are a pretty agressive people. And most of them aren't too bright, either. So these things happen *The Bork shrugs, and the very human gesture makes him look rather ridiculous.*
bork_embassy_test.4=It's a relatively new city. Old Shorter was destroyed. So we're rebuilding it, there are no tall buildings yet. 
bork_embassy_test.3=Shorter, yeah. But you can call it Sorter, too. Us borks are used to pronouncing the S as sh. A peculiarity of our vocal apparatus, it's easier for us that way. 
bork_embassy_test.2=You just have to know the best routes. *The Bork looks extremely pleased with himself* From the looks of it, you decided to look around Shorter after all. How did you like our capital? Did you see anything interesting on the way? 
bork_embassy_test.1=*The driver doesn't answer. The transport drives off. The same Bork who was at the spaceport greets you.*
bork_embassy_test.0=*The Bork Embassy is obviously built according to mixed standards: there are only four floors, but the building is huge. Your transport makes it past two rings of security (apparently, the guards are watching local porn and playing video games fervently) and stops next to the entrance* There we are.
bork_embassy_test.43=*The angry as hell troublemaker is walked out. The escort, having had his good laugh, lets you in to see the Diplomatic Representative.* 
bork_embassy_test.42=*Your training is good. You dodge away, and the clumsy Bork smashes straight into a wall with a mighty rumble. The next fifteen seconds transform the room into a playground for a game of cat-and-mouse: the Bork chases you, and you dodge him. You are interrupted by a wild, incredibly loud roar of the escort who finally got back. Obviously, it is laughter.*
bork_embassy_test.41=*The escort jumps out like a jack out of the box. The wounded Bork is driven away. Your explanation of what just happened is fully supported by the video surveillance feed. Asking you to forgive that misunderstanding, the escort sends you off to see the Diplomatic Representative.* 
bork_embassy_test.40=*You hear a loud bang, as if from a cannon, and the flash makes you tear up and shut your eyes. Without opening them, you smell gunpowder and some foul smell.  Although... no. The first thing to reach your conscience is the roar of the Bork lying down and clutching his bloodied leg, even louder than the shot. Only your excellent marksmanship has saved you from doing a whole lot of damage.* 
bork_embassy_test.39=*The escort rushes out the door almost immediately. Your explanation is corroborated by a video recording. Despite what just happened, after some time you are still allowed to talk to the Diplomatic Representative.*
bork_embassy_test.38=*You hear a loud bang, as if from a cannon, and the flash makes you tear up and shut your eyes. Without opening them, you smell gunpowder and some foul smell. Opening your eyes, you understand that it's Bork blood and scrambled brains. You killed the attacker.*
bork_embassy_test.37=I don't know. But you have to do something fast. *The Bork looks angrier by the second.* 
bork_embassy_test.36=*Henry narrows his eyes.* Captain, he's riling himself up. He's trying to make you mad, and himself, too. Try to calm him down. 
bork_embassy_test.35=What?! You don't wa- *The Bork breathes loudly and shakes his head.* 
bork_embassy_test.34=*The Bork jumps to his feet. The floor creaks audibly.* What, you think I'm dumb?! I asked you a question! Answer it!
bork_embassy_test.33=*The Bork speaks more loudly.* Hey! I asked you a question! You, go first?!
bork_embassy_test.32=Borks aren't usually like that. I don't like this. I'm confused. I only know one thing: if something happens, you have to act decisively and without hesitation. *The Bork is still making a ruckus. The escort still isn't there.* 
bork_embassy_test.31=I appreciate the sarcasm, Captain. Back to the subject at hand, it's weird. It's like he's trying to provoke you and himself on purpose. 
bork_embassy_test.30=*The Bork gets angry, begins to wave his hands around and grabs his holster. The situation in the waiting room becomes dangerous. The escort still isn't there.*
