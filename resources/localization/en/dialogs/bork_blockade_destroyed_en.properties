bork_blockade_destroyed.2=Am I complaining? It's okay\u2026 more or less. But you could have tried to do it quieter. You know, if we wanted to destroy the blockade, we could have launched a couple of rockets ourself, couldn't we?
bork_blockade_destroyed.1=Okay, but\u2026 Have you turned the TV on? The people are panicking, and random scummy prophets are already preaching about the end of the world. You shouldn't have done it.
bork_blockade_destroyed.0=Apparently, the blockade is destroyed.
bork_blockade_destroyed.0.0=Yeah. I didn't have a choice.
bork_blockade_destroyed.2.0=You're impossible to please. Anyway, all right. What's done is done, we can't change that. I have to go.
bork_blockade_destroyed.1.0=Martan, I didn't have another choice. I really didn't.
