inside_first_destroyed.3=By chaotically changing the structure of the system. *Gordon cleans his glasses.* The easiest way is destruction. I've taken part in similar experiments before. To cause breaches in various systems, we would use massive bombardments with neutrons. 
inside_first_destroyed.2=*He grimaces.* It's my job. 
inside_first_destroyed.1=Breaches in the system, you understand? Very high instability. Massive and fast increase in entropy will cause another wormhole for sure, like the one through which we got here. 
inside_first_destroyed.0=*Gordon calls you himself. He looks very tired, there are huge circles under his eyes, and his normally pale skin has become especially white.* C... *He stutters, covers his mouth with his hand, and speaks again, monotonously.* Captain. We can... we can get out.
inside_first_destroyed.3.0=So, to put it simply, I have to break everything I can?
inside_first_destroyed.4.1=I think it'll take a lot of time. Any ideas? 
inside_first_destroyed.4.0=Great, got it. Over and out. Go get some rest, huh? 
inside_first_destroyed.0.0=I'm listening.
inside_first_destroyed.5.0=Okay. Time to get to work. And you go get some rest or something, Gordon.
inside_first_destroyed.1.1=Increase in entropy? And how do we do it? 
inside_first_destroyed.1.0=Got it. Gordon, you look terrible. 
inside_first_destroyed.5=None. Keep us supplied with similar samples, maybe we'll make something of it. Or maybe we won't. Who knows? Whatever the case, I'll send a list of the necessary samples to your private mail. Take a look at your journal when you can, Captain.
inside_first_destroyed.4=Yes. Metaphorically speaking, we have to... *Gordon sighs and grimaces, speaking more loudly now.* We have to kill this universe. *He realizes that he's being overly dramatic and adds.* Make a piece of it dead. Destroy everything that's in your reach. 
inside_first_destroyed.2.0=Increase in entropy? And how do we do it?
