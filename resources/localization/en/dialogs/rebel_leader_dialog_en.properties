rebel_leader_dialog.4.0=Don't speak too soon. Let's put it like this: you've piqued my interest me, but I still don't understand who you are. And what is all this, anyway? The message was pretty strange.
rebel_leader_dialog.99=*the Zorsan waits patiently, looking at you*
rebel_leader_dialog.11.0=Got it.
rebel_leader_dialog.3.0=You were... Okay. You were good in there. You got hit with electricity, too. Was it bad?
rebel_leader_dialog.19.0=Right. Where do we start?
rebel_leader_dialog.9=There is no catch. The job is hard, you could die, but... *The Zorsan shrugs.* That comes with the job, right?
rebel_leader_dialog.10.0=So what, you're not going to tell me anything else?
rebel_leader_dialog.8=I think you can do us a pretty big favor. On the other hand, yes, your services would cost us, this is logical and correct. Working for us, you can make some money and get revenge on the Zorsan Imperial system. Pretty nifty, right?
rebel_leader_dialog.7=*He nods phlegmatically in response. The Zorsan reclines in his chair.* Our peoples are at war. No one needs that, you see? You don't, I don't. Your people don't, my people don't either. They do. *He points up, narrows his eyes sorely, and brings his head down.* I mean, all of them. The Emperor, and those people like Zheurde. That's why you're my comrade, albeit unknowingly.
rebel_leader_dialog.6=What about it?
rebel_leader_dialog.5=Wait! *The Zorsan smiles.* Let's do it one question at a time. Not all at once.
rebel_leader_dialog.4=No. *He shows you his thick hands with distinctive burn marks.* Wasn't the first time. *He walks up to his desk and gets dressed.* You've found this place. That's great, human captain. I'm glad that we'll be working together!
rebel_leader_dialog.2.1=Hurry up.
rebel_leader_dialog.3=Yeah, yeah! *Instead of the grunts, you can now hear crackles, then a clang, and then a small pop. The Zorsan jumps up in a funny way, banging with his heavy boots, and jumps away from the panel.* I think... I think... *He looks at it attentively.* Yeah... Yeah. That's all. *He walks up to the panel and shuts it. You can see that the owner of the room is naked down to his waist. He's weirdly wide, like all Zorsan, but not because he's fat: apparently, that's just how he's built. You wouldn't say he's muscular. More like wiry. And also bald. He is about two heads shorter than you.* Sorry again, human captain. I'm pretty good at electronics, and I tend to my room myself.
rebel_leader_dialog.18.1=You know... I think I'll ask you something else.
rebel_leader_dialog.2.0=Uh... All right.
rebel_leader_dialog.2=\"*What is there to say? It really is the navigator's quarters. At least, the first thing you see is a big dynamic map of the system. Almost like the one at your ship (you plot your course on it
rebel_leader_dialog.18.0=I already told you. Yes.
rebel_leader_dialog.1=*In front of the door that says \"Navigator's Quarters\" (you've gotten good at alien languages, haven't you?) they stop you.* Alone, human captain. You don't have to surrender your weapon.
rebel_leader_dialog.0=*The station's interior isn't too tidy. It's pretty old, there are signs of being in battle a lot and being repaired afterwards. At least it seems reliable. \"Seems\" is the operating word. It even has an elevator! Now that's a miracle. This place suits the rebels well: their faces are tense, they look pretty tough. You're led to \"our boss\" in a small convoy down narrow station corridors. Both the rebels and your people are alert. The atmosphere is rather tense.*
rebel_leader_dialog.22.0=Got it. Well, I think this has been a good beginning.
rebel_leader_dialog.1.0=Okay. *go inside*
rebel_leader_dialog.17.0=Good luck in your endeavor. You'll need it.
rebel_leader_dialog.99.4=Well, I understand most of it.
rebel_leader_dialog.99.3=What is this station?
rebel_leader_dialog.22=Just because. We change our flight patterns randomly so that they don't find us. Right now, it's like this.
rebel_leader_dialog.99.2=Who are you guys?
rebel_leader_dialog.21=That's right! I'm glad it worked out like that, Human Captain. Good luck. And goodbye.
rebel_leader_dialog.99.1=All right. Your message.
rebel_leader_dialog.20=Right now? Nothing. *Folie walks up to one of the monitors that is showing some graph.* We have to go to hyperspace for a month. Preventive measures and changing our location. When we come back again, that's when it'll all start. I suggest you get your affairs in order and get good weapons, at least equip your ship. You can consider the money transferred already. And we'll meet in the same place again: red giant systems in Zorsan space.
rebel_leader_dialog.99.0=Let's start with the basics. What do I call you?
rebel_leader_dialog.9.0=True. I want to ask something else.
rebel_leader_dialog.21.0=You too, Fplie.
rebel_leader_dialog.16.1=You know... I think I'll ask you something else.
rebel_leader_dialog.0.0=\u2026
rebel_leader_dialog.16.0=Yes. Sorry again.
rebel_leader_dialog.8.1=True. I want to ask something else.
rebel_leader_dialog.8.0=There must be a catch.
rebel_leader_dialog.20.1=Oh. That's a good beginning.
rebel_leader_dialog.15.2=I want to ask you something else.
rebel_leader_dialog.20.0=Why is it always red giant?
rebel_leader_dialog.15.1=I don't know if you're right. Maybe I'll understand later, maybe I won't. Doesn't matter. I'm up for it.
rebel_leader_dialog.15.0=I've heard what you have to say. And I understand it. But I don't want to work for you, sorry.
rebel_leader_dialog.19=In that case, welcome, my friend!! *Folie jumps up and pats your shoulder.* With you... wow! We'll do it with you for sure! That's for certain!
rebel_leader_dialog.7.1=Okay. That's not the only question I have.
rebel_leader_dialog.18=Are you sure? *Folie narrows his eyes.* This is war.
rebel_leader_dialog.7.0=Money? Revenge?
rebel_leader_dialog.17=Too bad. It really is too bad. Well, all right. We'll see you to the airlock.
rebel_leader_dialog.16=Are you sure?
rebel_leader_dialog.15=What do you understand, then? Are you ready to risk your life and try to take some freedom back, but for the good Zorsan, not yourself? Are you ready to get your hands dirty for that? I'll tell you right away, despite the money, the things you'll be doing won't always be clean. But you have to do those things sometimes, you do! You can't do it any other way! Or everything... What is the point of having power if the only ones who can use it are the rich and the rats?
rebel_leader_dialog.14=Oh... We captured it a year ago. *He frowns, then smiles broadly.* It's a roaming station. The Rogues use it to mine things. It's an old model, but it's reliable. It can stay in hyperspace for months. The bastards still haven't found us.
rebel_leader_dialog.14.0=Got it.
rebel_leader_dialog.13=*The Zorsan shakes his head.* Terrorists, if you believe the official definition. I just think I'm the one who's right, and my comrades are freedom fighters. You see? Doesn't matter. You'll see it in time. That's what I'm going to say.
rebel_leader_dialog.12=Us? We're simple Zorsan. We don't want power, we don't want to be rich. We just to live simply and to live well. And that's impossible with the Emperor in charge. That's why we're here. And you. And all of the rest.
rebel_leader_dialog.11=*Folie smiles* No, human captain. I'm not interrogating you, am I? Let's try to keep it simple.
rebel_leader_dialog.10=Folie. Just Folie. Everyone calls me that. And I'm the boss here. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. We're still alive. Must be a good thing, then.
rebel_leader_dialog.6.1=You're right.. Okay. Let's not talk about it.
rebel_leader_dialog.6.0=What did you mean? \"Comrade\", \"money\", \"revenge on the wrongdoers\".
rebel_leader_dialog.13.0=Right... there's something else.
rebel_leader_dialog.5.4=Well, I understand most of it.
rebel_leader_dialog.5.3=What is this station?
rebel_leader_dialog.5.2=Same thing again. Who are you guys?
rebel_leader_dialog.5.1=All right. Your message.
rebel_leader_dialog.5.0=Let's start with the basics. Who are you?
rebel_leader_dialog.12.0=How about some details?
