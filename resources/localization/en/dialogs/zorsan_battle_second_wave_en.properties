zorsan_battle_second_wave.1=They'll probably try to get their landing parties to Earth. I don't really know what they're trying to achieve, to be honest, - capture the entire planet with a small force? Ground forces are ready to attack their disembarcation points, but we'd better finish this before they reach the surface. So try to destroy the ground attack ships first.
zorsan_battle_second_wave.0=There is a new wave of enemy ships. This time they're big, they look like ground attack ships.
zorsan_battle_second_wave.0.0=What are my orders?
zorsan_battle_second_wave.1.0=Roger.
