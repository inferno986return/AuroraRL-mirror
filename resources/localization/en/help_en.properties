start=Welcome to Aurora RL. As the captain of a research space ship, your main task is discovering new things in space and bringing them back to Earth.
galaxy_map=Our space ship has just left the Solar system and is now on the Star Map. Use the arrow keys to move around in it.\n\
To visit a different star system, fly up to its star and click “Enter the system.”
galaxy_map_2=When you click “Star map”, you can see the map of the entire galaxy. Systems you have pending quests in are marked by green circles.\n\
You can browse your quests by clicking “Journal.” You can also set a current research goal for your voyage in the available research screen.
galaxy_map_3=You are free to plot any itinerary you want for your ship. Every system can be visited, but be ready to find unknown dangers there. And remember that your decision may affect the entire human race.
star_system=You entered a star system. To leave it and go back to the Star Map, cross the red border line.\n\
You can visit planets and spaceships. To do it, move your ship to the tile they are occupying and press Enter.
star_system_2=When you are in a star system, your scientists can study celestial bodies in it. This is governed by the Astronomy research, which is always available and may grant you some additional points.\n\
Every system contains a finite amount of astronomical data to research.
star_system_battle=To attack space objects, use the weapon buttons in the bottom left corner, or press keys from 1 through 4 on your keyboard.\n\
Weapons need a few turns to reload. Use the “End turn” button in the bottom right corner to wait until they are reloaded.
star_system_battle_2=You can attack any target, but friendly ships will turn hostile if you shoot at them. If they manage to leave the star system alive, they will spread the news about your attack to their allies, which will lead to a decrease in your reputation.

planet=You landed on a planet. To return to your ship, get the landing party back to the shuttle and press Enter.
planet_2=To attack monsters, press F or the “Fire” button. You can bring back the bodies of the monsters you kill to your ship and study them.
planet_3=If the atmosphere on a planet is unbreathable, or there is none at all, the landing party will spend oxygen every turn. You can replenish your oxygen on the tile with the shuttle.\n\
If there is no oxygen left, the entire landing party will die.\n\
If the atmosphere is poisonous or there is none at all, there is a chance that a platoon member will die due to depressurization of his space suit after being wounded regardless of his health status.
