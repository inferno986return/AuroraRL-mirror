start=Welcome to Aurora RL. As the captain of a research space ship, your main task is discovering new things in space and bringing them back to Earth.
galaxy_map=Our space ship has just left the Solar system and is now on the Star Map. Use the arrow keys to move around in it.\n\
To visit a different star system, fly up to its star and click 'Enter the system.'
galaxy_map_2=When you click 'Star map', you can see the map of the entire galaxy. Systems you have pending quests in are marked by green circles.\n\
You can browse your quests by clicking 'Journal.' You can also set a current research goal for your voyage in the available research screen.
galaxy_map_3=You are free to plot any itinerary you want for your ship. Every system can be visited, but be ready to find unknown dangers there. And remember that your decision may affect the entire human race.
star_system=You entered a star system. To leave it and go back to the Star Map, cross the red border line.\n\
You can visit planets and spaceships. To do it, move your ship to the tile they are occupying and press Enter.
star_system_2=When you are in a star system, your scientists can study celestial bodies in it. This is governed by the Astronomy research, which is always available and may grant you some additional points.\n\
Every system contains a finite amount of astronomical data to research.
star_system_battle=To attack space objects, use the weapon buttons in the bottom left corner, or press keys from 1 through 4 on your keyboard.\n\
Weapons need a few turns to reload. Use the 'End turn' button in the bottom right corner to wait until they are reloaded.
star_system_battle_2=You can attack any target, but friendly ships will turn hostile if you shoot at them. If they manage to leave the star system alive, they will spread the news about your attack to their allies, which will lead to a decrease in your reputation.

planet_scan=On this screen, you can see the surface of the planet your ship is orbiting and pick a destination for your landing party.
planet_scan_2=Different colors mark the approximate location of important objects: artefacts and plot-important objects (red), resources (yellow), and wild animals (green).
planet_scan_3=Drag the shuttle icon to your chosen destination. You cannot land on water or mountains.

planet=You landed on a planet. To return to your ship, get the landing party back to the shuttle and press Enter.
planet_2=To attack monsters, press F or the 'Fire' button. You can bring back the bodies of the monsters you kill to your ship and study them.
planet_3=If the atmosphere on a planet is unbreathable, or there is none at all, the landing party will spend oxygen every turn. You can replenish your oxygen on the tile with the shuttle.\n\
If there is no oxygen left, the entire landing party will die.\n\
If the atmosphere is poisonous or there is none at all, there is a chance that a platoon member will die due to depressurization of his space suit after being wounded regardless of his health status.

tutorial.1.1=To complete the test assignment, you need to find the Iowa ship orbiting Mars. Move your ship using arrow keys.
tutorial.2.1=To make sure the ship is the one you need, put yourself in the same tile and press "Scan." \n\
You can scan ships to get additional information, and planets in order to view the map of their surface.
tutorial.2.2=To attack your target, use the weapons mounted on your ship using the buttons in the lower left part of the screen,\
or by pressing 1-4 on your keyboard.\n\
When you activate a weapon, its effective radius is displayed. You can cycle through available targets using the buttons at the bottom of the screen\
or the arrow keys on your keyboard.
tutorial.3.1=Every weapon has its reloading time. To wait until it's reloaded, you can either skip a few turns using the button in the lower right of the screen,\
or just fly around.
tutorial.4.1=To find something on the planet, you need to scan its surface. Fly up to the planet and click the "Scan" button which should appear. \n\
Plot important objects, alien artefacts and other anomalies will be marked red on the map.
tutorial.5.1=You have a new object to study: the drone debris. You will encounter similar objects throughout the game: various artefacts, debris of alien ships,\
data disks etc. Researching them will net you points that you can spend on buying upgrades, and it could also unlock new objects, techs or quests.
tutorial.5.2=Go to the research screen to see projects available for research and allocate scientists to work on them.

research=This is the research screen. Here you can allocate scientists to projects and track their progress. \n\
New research projects will be unlocked as you find various artefacts and interesting objects in space, or they will be given to you by your Earth superiors.
research_2=Special projects Cartography and Astronomy allow you to gather some scientific data through passive study of objects in your star system. They are always available.
research_3=Increase and decrease the amount of scientists working on the project using + and - buttons. \n\
Keep in mind that only free scientists (those aren't involved in any project) may be allocated to a landing party.
