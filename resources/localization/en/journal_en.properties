aurora_desc.title=Project Aurora Spaceships
aurora_desc.1=AURORA 2, A BRIEF SUMMARY(1)\n\
\n\
Ship class: AURORA 2(2)\n\
\n\
Technical characteristics: The Aurora 2 is a piloted, highly maneuverable(3) research ship capable of Hyperjump(4) travel into deep space(5). Compared to the Aurora 1, it is larger(6), but has less impressive performance characteristics(7) as a consequence of having a somewhat outdated engine system and bigger mass. \n\
The ship's life support systems are designed for a crew of three hundred, but allow for up to a two-fold short-term increase (no longer than a month). \n\
The Aurora 2 carries standard industrial Class YAH modules (8), standard research modules of the same class and a separate barracks area outfitted according with state-of-the art equipment. \n\
The Aurora 2 is not designed for operation in atmospheric and gravitational conditions similar to those of Earth. (9). For planetary missions, the ship is equipped with three PROSPECTOR system shuttles (10) designed for transporting personnel and equipment. \n\
 \n\
Modules:\n\
The Aurora 2, compared to the Aurora 1, provides more comfortable living conditions for the crew, which was achieved through enhancing its weight-and-dimensional characteristics and reducing its peak acceleration. Apart from the YAH industrial and research modules, the standard package consists of:\n\
1.	Family  Habitation Module (incl. water and food recirculator in case of emergency) designed for providing a comfortable living standard for an average family (11). \n\
2.	Class A entertainment module(12). \n\
3.	Special issue YAH-2 medical module(13). \n\
\n\
To conclude,  it bears mentioning that the Aurora 2 was constructed following the so-called Clark Directive(14) to the letter. \n\

\n\
(1)	This summary does not contain exact technical specifications or other details. It is aimed at people who do not have special technical education, and was created to provide them with basic familiarity with the Aurora 2. \n\
(2)	Aurora 1 is the Aurora ship that was developed by the Aurora International Project. \n\
(3)	For a space object of considerable mass\n\
(4)	See article 'Hyperspace engine' of the abridged or unabridged edition of the Standard Educational Encyclopedia\n\
(5)	Outside of the Solar system\n\
(6)	The Aurora 1 housed 200 crew members and did not support installation of additional modules. The Aurora 2 is designed to house 300 people and does support the installation of the aforementioned additional modules. \n\
(7)	Of course, talking about the maximum velocity of a space object is a bit silly. \n\
(8)	For details consult the Full Specifications of Spaceship Aurora 2, p. 829-1203\n\
(9)	Solely due to the structure of the engines. In case they are modified (which is unlikely considering the current level of technology, but possible in theory), the Aurora 2 will be capable of short-term planetside flight. The Aurora 1 does not have that capability. n\
(10) Length 50m, diameter 7m, working load 50 tons. \n\
(11) ATTENTION! The Family Habitation Module is not designed for long-time support of elderly or disabled persons. \n\
(12) The A class entertainment module, apart from the usual film theater and game room, contains an artificial park area with a system capable of realistic imitation of weather. Brought to the Aurora 2 by FaF (Fun and Family), formerly known as UAC. \n\
(13) UAH-2 medical module. Equipped with a prototype tissue regeneration system. Important: in case of a system crash, you need to force the YAH-OS operating system to roll back to version 25.0.0.3 and select YAH-1 instead of YAH-2; although it will render the prototype system out of commission, it will allow you to use regular medical devices. \n\
(14) See article 'Isaac Clark' of the abridged or unabridged edition of the Standard Educational Encyclopedia. The Clark Directive states: 'Every module and mechanism utilized in a spaceship must, in case of a software or mechanical shutdown, be able to function autonomously (as a system or several subsystems) through manual exploitation.' \n\
(15) Calling the number is only free for the employees of special offices of the Department of Cosmonautics. Full Specifications of Spaceship Aurora 2 will only be provided for usage in similar special departments.

colony_search.title=Colonization
colony_search.start=The Aurora disappeared under unknown circumstances. Of course, it has to be found, but there are much more pressing matters: the energy crisis, for one. To solve it, we need to find a planet suitable for colonization not far from the Solar system. A methodical check of every star system will probably take up a lot of time, so we need to hurry. \n\
The planet in question will have to be medium-sized, have breathable atmosphere, have biological activity, and have some reserves of natural resources. To evaluate the habitability of a planet, I need to explore at least 200 tiles and, naturally, collect samples of minerals and local wildlife.
colony_search.klisk_help=Our new friends have provided us with the coordinates of a planet that is, according to them, perfect for colonization and extraction of resources: ${colony_search.klisk_coords}. They also said something about a dangerous fauna, but I doubt there's anything that could seriously impede colonization. In any case, we still have to do a preliminary exploration.
colony_search.found=So... the planet has been found, now it's time for a preliminary exploration. According to the scanner readings, they weren't kidding about the local fauna. I should warn Henry.
colony_search.explored=Well then, the preliminary exploration is done. Good news is, it does have the resources the Earth needs so much. The bad news is, the local fauna won't take kindly to the new tenants, but they'll just have to deal with it. \n\
Now we have to deliver this information to Earth.
colony_search.colonists_departure=The first colonist party is already aboard the ship and awaiting delivery to their destination.
colony_search.colonists_arrival=The first colonist party has been successfully delivered to their destination. I hope they'll be okay there. We should pay them a visit sometime, just in case they need our help.
colony_search.map_label=Human colony

colony_search.hunt=The colonist leader has asked us to hunt some of the annoying local animals. \
Five monster corpses will be enough. In return, they've promised us to share some scientific data\
and samples.
colony_search.dungeon=The colonist leader has told us about about a group of speleologists\
that has gone missing in one of the caves and asked us to find them. The cave is marked red\
on the planet map.
colony_search.dungeon_end=Unfortunately, we were too late. All the scientists fell victim\
to the local fauna.
colony_search.lost_group=The colonist leader has asked us to find a group of researchers\
that has gone missing. The scanner might pick them up, they'll be marked red on the map.
colony_search.lost_group.scientist_killed_message=One of the missing scientists dies.
colony_search.lost_group.all_done_message=All the missing scientists are either dead or saved, we can go back.
colony_search.lost_group.good=We got there on time and saved all the scientists.
colony_search.lost_group.ok=We couldn't save all of them, but a few people made it.
colony_search.lost_group.bad=Unfortunately, we were too late. All the missing scientists\
were already dead when we arrived.

last_beacon.title=The Last Beacon
last_beacon.start=The Aurora went missing and we need to find it. All we know about its fate is that the ship was heading to ${last_beacon.coords} when it disappeared. We have no idea what we may have to face, since the Aurora, according to its reports, came in contact with a great deal of phenomena that haven't been studied (including alien civilizations); any one of them could have been the reason the ship disappeared so mysteriously.
last_beacon.gardener=Talking to the Gardener didn't clear anything up and, in fact, confused me even more. The only clear piece of advice that tree-ship dweller gave me was to visit the space station in the same system. The Gardener said the owners of the station would help me contact other aliens.
last_beacon.klisk_minimal=I found out the coordinates of the homeworlds of every race, and I even traded some info about humans in exchange for intel about one of those homeworlds. I think that's enough for now, I don't want to risk too much. I'll have to check the planet the Klisk directed me to, as well. He said it was perfectly suitable for colonization.
last_beacon.klisk_max=Now I know the coordinates of every race's homeworld, and that's very good. Was it wise to trade detailed information about humans, even in exchange for the same information about a different civilization? I think it was. After all, there was no critical intel in that package, and the brass probably would have decided to do the same. And I also got the coordinates of a colonizable planet. One less thing to worry about.
last_beacon.klisk_minimal_no_coords=I found out the coordinates of the homeworlds of every race, and I even traded some info about humans in exchange for intel about one of those homeworlds. I think that's enough for now, I don't want to risk too much. But I still think I didn't present myself to the Klisk well enough and missed out on something. Too bad, but who could blame me? It was our first encounter with an alien race, after all.
last_beacon.klisk_max_no_coords= Now I know the coordinates of every race's homeworld, and that's very good. Was it wise to trade detailed information about humans, even in exchange for the same information about a different civilization? I think it was. After all, there was no critical info in that package, although the brass would probably tell me I received too little in exchange for such valuable intelligence. Well... now I think that it's true myself.
last_beacon.klisk_homeworlds=Homeworld coordinates received from the Klisks:\n\
  Klisks: ${klisk.homeworld} \n\
  Zorsan: ${zorsan.homeworld} \n\
  Borks: ${bork.homeworld} \n\
  Rogues: ${rogues.homeworld}
last_beacon.end=Unfortunately, we didn't find out anything new about the Aurora 1. We'll have to look in other places; maybe we'll pick up their trail.

klisk.title=Alien race: Klisks
klisk.main=Homeworld: KLYSKASAKLYSKA (note: this is the most accurate Latin transcription of the name. The Klisks themselves prefer to call their planet Kliskada, or just Klisk.)\n\
Coordinates: ${klisk.homeworld}\n\
Brief historical and biological summary: \n\
\n\
The Klisks have not had the opportunity to get battle-hardened by ways of serious conflict: there are few predators on Kliskada, and the climate there is mild. The Klisks never had big conflicts even in the multi-state era. \n\
Their planet is rather remarkable: most of it is covered with a desert. Despite the mild climate and underground waterways with fresh water, it is hard to understand how creatures similar to the Klisks could have evolved on it. \n\
Kliskada's artificial moon is also worth mentioning: it is a giant (even by planetary standards) spacestation. It functions as a customs office, a hotel and an apartment office for the elite, and contains numerous shopping malls. This station is the apex of the Klisks' engineering and scientific talent. \n\
Kliskada has no natural moons. \n\
\n\
The Klisks are typical gastropoda that have a pair of frontal limbs as a result of the evolutionary process. However, those limbs are not very developed because the Klisk spine is exceptionally weak. One more thing that separates the Klisks from the rest of the gastropoda is the developed eye-bulb that they put to good use. \n\
It is the Klisks' physical weakness that explains their passion for transdevelopment. n\
Physical description of a typical Klisk individual:\n\
Length: 180-200cm\n\
Height: 100-120cm\n\
Body color: varies from dark green to the so-called 'frog bottom' color, i.e. grayish yellow. \n\
\n\
NOTES:\n\
A Klisk without an antigrav device is a rather nasty creature, since it utilizes slime for smoother gliding when it moves. \n\
The so-called antennae on the Klisks' heads have nothing to do with telepathy or other pseudoscientific fairy tales. They are ctenidia, breathing organs. \n\
\n\
Culture:\n\
The Klisks are a peaceful race, and their historical development has happened without conflict. This is why the Klisks' trade and diplomatic traditions are the most developed and ancient in the known galaxy. \n\
It is because of this that the Klisks are considered a race of intergalactic merchants and diplomats, and they are often contracted for talks by parties who cannot come into direct contact, be it due to simply being enemies or due to being creatures that cannot even see each other. \n\
The Klisk culture is pretty diverse, but in order to develop a working relationship with them, it is highly advisable that you study the Code of Commerce, which the Klisks regard as something in between of a religious text and a regular collection of rules and advice. \n\
The Code is the main source of most cultural quirks of the Klisks, since any operation (business or otherwise) by this nation is carried out following the Code to the letter. Pretty often these natural-born merchants will sacrifice their profits because of this, which defies all logical explanation. \n\
Their form of government is a corporatocracy. The planet is ruled by a conglomerate of corporations, which, for this culture, is business as usual. \n\
\n\
There are not too many things you have to take into account when talking to the Klisks, and the most important one is the Code. Someone who is rational and able to comprehend its logic (or at least to use it for his own profit) will gain the friendship and respect of this race.

bork.title=Alien race: Borks
bork.main=Homeworld: Sypsyar (pronounced 'Sip-see-uh' with the stress on the first syllable; the Borks traditionally pronounce it as 'Ship-shyar', which is also correct)\n\
Coordinates: ${bork.homeworld}\n\
Brief historical and biological summary:\n\
Sypsyar is not the Borks' home planet; they settled it over three centuries ago after a mass migration from an unknown deep space region. Judging from their build, these creatures' home planet was marked by high natural radiation, harsh climate and highly aggressive fauna. Nothing else is known about their home. \n\
Sypsyar is a regular habitable planet of the 'precious blue' kind, i.e. containing large water reserves and an oxygen-based atmosphere, making it perfectly suitable for most lifeforms. \n\
\n\
The past of the Borks themselves can be easily read from their build: this is a race of natural-born fighters. They have a powerful spine (research has shown that the thickness of the rib shell of some individuals approaches 25mm), highly developed musculature, and four pairs of eyes. To draw an analogy with the terrestrial fauna, the Borks are not dissimilar to giant testudines; extremely fast, strong and aggressive testudines. \n\
Physical description of a typical Bork individual:\n\
Height: 200-300cm (never less than 200)\n\
Ribcage at the widest point: 150-170cm\n\
Skin color: yellow, sometimes burgundy. \n\
\n\
NOTES:\n\
There are unconfirmed claims that Bork males have three pairs of testicles, which is the reason for their heightened aggression. However, this information is most probably false. \n\
\n\
Culture:\n\
An important fact has to be taken into account when studying the Bork culture: 60% of the Borks suffer from arrested mental development. This biological mechanism has not been extensively studied yet, but we do know that only Bork twins are normally developed (by the galactic standard), whereas single children are oligophrenic (an approximation, not the exact term). \n\
This is why most of the space pirates and criminals in the Galaxy are Borks. Usually, they do not have good equipment or fine-honed skills, but they could be dangerous in large numbers. \n\
Their form of government is timocratic. \n\
\n\
When talking to the Borks, one has to remember that their customs are extremely brutish and aggressive: one may witness fistfights and cursing even during official meetings, which do not influence their outcome in any way. However, it is worth remembering that Bork fistfights rarely lead to fatalities, which is caused by their etiquette and physiological traits. \n\

rogues.title=Alien race: Rogues
rogues.main=Homeplanet unknown. Species' original autonym unknown. Currently the Rogues inhabit several giant Motherships which house most of the species. \n\
Main Mothership coordinates: ${rogues.homeworld}\n\
  \n\
Brief historical and biological summary:\n\
No one knows what happened to the Rogues' homeplanet. It is only known that it was destroyed ('destroyed' is the keyword; this is the only thing we know for sure). The fact that space has become the Rogues' new home is no less remarkable. \n\
After that, the Rogues got the fame of being, well, rogues in the intergalactic society: a lot of blind spots have disappeared from the map of the Galaxy thanks to these tireless wanderers. \n\
But, after from 80 to 100 years, the Rogues became somewhat isolated and stopped providing their services as explorers. This coincided with a new religion getting more popular in their society, which was quickly adopted by the absolute most of the population in a very short period of time. \n\
Although, individual Rogues still carry out exploring activities. \n\
\n\
The Rogues are a humanoid race. Never taller than 180cm, scrawny, greenish-gray skin. Their frontal limbs (arms) are practically analogous to those of humans, except the hands: instead of five fingers the Rogues have three, all of them long, flexible and sensitive, obviously having become like that artificially (this is corroborated by the Rogues' practice of contacting their technology directly). \n\
Physical description of a typical Rogue individual:\n\
Height: 160-180cm\n\
Weight: 45-55kg\n\
Large head\n\
Black eye irises, distinct pupil of a dim color (possible false eyelid?)\n\
\n\
Culture and other peculiarities:\n\
It is hard to say what the Rogues were like before the advent of the new religion that is extremely popular in their society; now, their entire way of life is constructed around it. \n\
The religion is hard to understand, but it is possible that it is based on accepting the mortality of everything ('And the suns will fade, and the quasars will shine no more, because He will come, and like did our planet, all will suffer the same fate at His hand.') It is possible that 'He' is a metaphor of the death of the Universe and disintegration of matter, but this interpretation is imprecise by default. \n\
Their form of government is theocratic, with the power concentrated in the hands of five Patriarchs. \n\
It is hard to say what one should emphasize during diplomatic contact with this race: they have changed radically. The only thing that is obvious is that one should start with their religion, adapting to it but staying oneself and keeping one's identity. \n\

zorsan.title=Alien race: Zorsan
zorsan.main=Homeworld: <LATIN TRANSCRIPTION IMPOSSIBLE> (note: exceptionally hard to pronounce, the closest approximation is, obviously, 'Zorsan'). A completely normal and unremarkable planet. 60% water, 40% land, cold climate. \n\
Coordinates: ${zorsan.homeworld}\n\
\n\
Brief historical and biological summary:\n\
Zorsan is the planet that has the biggest variety of ancient alien artifacts. This explains the Zorsan chauvinism: it is what their concept of being 'chosen' that has dominated the culture since its inception is built on. \n\
The Zorsan are a rather belligerent race. They have decent space technology and generally are not the best enemy to have. There have been mentions of small conflicts between the Zorsan and the Borks, although they have never escalated to anything serious. \n\
Physical description of a typical Zorsan individual:\n\
Height: 140-150cm\n\
Weight: 50-60kg\n\
Two developed eyes, a third underdeveloped one on the forehead (atavism?) \n\
Somewhat enlarged and massive head. \n\
\n\
Culture and other peculiarities:\n\
As mentioned above, large quantities of ancient alien artifacts have made the Zorsan consider themselves 'the Chosen People,' which makes them rather chauvinistic. They consider all alien species as second-class creatures that were not lucky enough to have fate (note: the closest translation of the word used by the Zorsan) make them be born on Zorsan. \n\
Despite this, the Zorsan culture is pretty developed in many aspects. Zorsan literature and especially their theater are respected even by the other species. \n\
Their form of government is an empire, constitutional monarchy. \n\
\n\
It is hard to give any advice to those who attempt to breach the wall of Zorsan pride and antagonism towards the aliens; the only thing one could do is to be courteous and to speak with the due (or even exaggerated) respect. And to be careful, of course: the Zorsan have shown 'resentment' towards alien diplomats more than once.

klisk_trade_drone.title=Your Wallet or Your Comms
klisk_trade_drone.start=Sarah reports that some object is trying to jam our communications, and that object is orbiting the Earth. It's probably some new research satellite, but we have to check it out regardless.
klisk_trade_drone.drone_desc=All right, it wasn't a satellite. It was a Klisk trading bot selling random junk. God damn it! Even in space you're not safe from traveling salesmen.
klisk_trade_drone.problem=Yeah, I suspected something like this. Apparently, the bot isn't only jamming the comms on our ship, it's also jamming them on Earth. We have to do something quick: while this space dumpster sends out communications, GPS and cable TV are out on Earth, we keep losing contact with our spacecraft and aircraft... It's not ideal.
klisk_trade_drone.task=The bot can't just fly off. It can't give me the location of its boss, either. Why does everything have to be so difficult?\n\
I don't have much choice: I either destroy the bot, find whoever it is that owns it, or... buy everything it has for sale. Ten credits. A bit much, but it's not highway robbery, either.
klisk_trade_drone.destroyed=Bot destroyed, problem solved. \n\
I have to report this to Martan.
klisk_trade_drone.withdrawed=The Klisk diplomatic representative turned out to have connections in the Hakazar Company, which owns the bot. Since we have a good relationship, he promised to take care of the problem and get them to recall the bot. It's a good thing the solution was so simple. \n\
I have to report this to Martan.
klisk_trade_drone.buyAll=I bought all the samples that thing was selling, and now it's going back to base. I have to follow the bot and have some words with its management. \n\
Oh, and then I'll have to report all this to Martan.


bork_blockade.title=Blockade
bork_blockade.desc=Henry said that some ships set up a real blockade around Earth: they're orbiting it and capturing and sending back every ship that leaves the atmosphere. \n\ We have to put an end to that.
bork_blockade.comm=Turned out, it was the Borks... A really strange people. They want to rob Klisk ships, and they don't care that the Klisks aren't trading with Earth yet; they just ignored me when I told them about it. Their leader Hrrraka is exceptionally dumb. I wonder if they're all like that. \n\
IMPORTANT: They'll leave either following an order from a 'smart Bork' (probably someone high-ranking) or if I bring them the goods they want. \n\
They want 2 units of alien weaponry and 2 units of goods.\n\
I have to report this to Martan.
bork_blockade.order=Martan's orders are to deal with the situation as quickly as possible. As usual, I am authorized to do almost anything. Destroying the Borks is an option, of course, but not the most desirable one. Although their ships don't look too impressive, and Hrrraka doesn't seem like an apt captain. \n\
But solving the problem peacefully is possible. I have to either get the support of a 'smart Bork,' or get these wannabe pirates the goods they need. I can probably buy them or take them from someone with force.
bork_blockade.destroy=I decided not to bother trying to solve it peacefully and blew those morons up. Now I have to report this to Martan.
bork_blockade.withdraw=A 'smart Bork' called Kartar (also their diplomatic representative, which is amusing) provided me the coordinates of a decent spot to rob ships for the pirates blockading Earth. I'll relay them to Hrrraka, let him take his gang and get out of there.
bork_blockade.goods=I got the goods Hrrraka wanted, now I have to hand them over to him. I hope he'll be happy.
bork_blockade.goods_delivered=I delivered the goods to Hrraka. He was very glad, promised to help if we ever meet again and left the system.

rogues_altar.title=Mass
rogues_altar.enter=Gordon told me there was something weird happening on the Moon. Some weird changes to its gravity potential. We have to get over there and check it out. Or, if I'm in no hurry to get to Earth, we don't.
rogues_altar.earth=Martan greets me with breaking news: because of those changes with the Moon, Earth is going through a series of natural disasters. I have to go there and sort this all out. \n\
I better hurry. If I don't fix the situation, the natural disasters will go on.
rogues_altar.desc=A group of Rogues came to the Moon when we were there to pray. It's their altar (something very high-tech) that's causing all those perturbations. \n\
I don't know why they went with the moon of our planet, but we have to put an end to this. We'd better hurry; Earth doesn't need any more tsunamis.
rogues_altar.comm=Just as I had expected, asking them nicely wasn't enough. In order to leave, the Rogues have to sing mass, and they can't do it without a functioning altar. I don't know what happened to that damn thing, but it won't work. \n\
Of course, I can always make them leave by force, but I also can to talk to the guy who sent them here (some Elder Hoor from Mothership Brau). \n\
Or I could bring them the spare parts they need to fix their altar and hope their mass doesn't involve destroying the Moon.\n\
They need 2 units of alien computers, 1 unit of materials and 1 unit of power components.
rogues_altar.destroy=Those fanatics couldn't be reasoned with, so my guys had to teach them a lesson. They killed a couple of Rogues, and the rest flew away by themselves. I'm not glad it came to that, but those aliens should have shown a little more respect.
rogues_altar.withdraw=I talked to Elder Hoor. To celebrate the establishment of diplomatic ties between Earth and the Rogues, he resolved this situation. The Rogues have left the Moon.
rogues_altar.repair=Well, I got them the spare parts, now I have to hand them over to the Rogues. I hope they appreciate my efforts and don't take too long with their ritual. \n\
I'll have to report this to Martan later.


embassies.title=Embassies
embassies.start=The brass has given me a difficult task: to establish diplomatic ties with alien civilizations. \n\
First we have to find them, contact them, and arrange the exchange of embassies. \n\
The Klisks, the Zorsan, the Borks, and the Rogues. Who do I visit first?
embassies.zorsan=The Zorsan. \n\
Nothing went according to plan. Not only did their diplomatic representative turn out to be an arrogant bastard, but in the end they tried to capture us to find out the coordinates of the Earth. It's a good thing we managed to fight back and escape. \n\
I don't think a friendly relationship with the Zorsan is possible.
embassies.bork_kill=The Borks. \n\
While I was waiting to be called into the Bork diplomatic representative's office, there was an unpleasant incident. Some Bork kicked up a ruckus and provoked me to a fight. Then he charged me and, unfortunately, died while I was defending myself. \n\
As a result, Kartar Hrrraka, the Bork diplomatic representative, didn't accept our offer of cooperation and refused to help us in any way. I think it's all because of the incident in the waiting room. This is all too bad.
embassies.bork_miss=The Borks. \n\
While I was waiting to be called into the Bork diplomatic representative's office, there was an unpleasant incident. Some Bork was looking for a fight and attacked me. I had to jump around all over the waiting room dodging that moron. I couldn't just shoot him, could I?\n\
During the meeting I thought that Kartar Hrrraka, the Bork diplomatic representative, was subtly making fun of me. And it's all because I didn't respond aggressively to the aggression of the dumbass Bork in the waiting room. All right, doesn't matter. The important thing is that I've managed to arrange some basic cooperation between our planets.
embassies.bork_injure= The Borks. \n\
While I was waiting to be called into the Bork diplomatic representative's office, there was an unpleasant incident. Some typical Bork retard kicked up a fuss and finally tried to fight me. I didn't bother fighting him and shot him in the leg. Next time he'll think twice about charging humans. \n\
Kartar Hrrraka, the Bork diplomatic representative, was very respectful during the meeting. In the end he agreed to basic cooperation and promised to help us if we ever need it. I think the incident in his waiting room played a part in that. All the better.
embassies.klisk_refused=The Klisks. \n\
We're back. Eroloa tensed up when he found out about the captain's sickness, but he approved of my decision to wait until he was well and not try to do anything myself. All in all, it went well.
embassies.klisk_quest_refused=The Klisks. \n\
The Klisks are in favor of cooperation, but Eroloa made it pretty clear that we aren't getting any help from them right now. Maybe I shouldn't have refused from doing that small favor for him?
embassies.klisk_perfect=The Klisks. \n\
We're back. Eroloa tensed up a bit when he found out I did the deal myself. And then he looked like he got doused with salt when he realized how well I did it. Hah. It wasn't that hard to understand how they do business... or maybe I just got lucky. \n\
Eroloa is happy, and if I need his help, I'd better ask him for it right now.
embassies.klisk_good=The Klisks. \n\
We're back. Eroloa tensed up a bit when he found out I did the deal myself, but I think we're good. He's okay with the results, since I'd decided not to bother and buy it all with hard cash. I know the Klisks prefer bartering goods for other goods, but I couldn't understand their system and decided not to risk it. \n\
All in all, Eroloa is happy, and if I need his help, I'd better ask him for it right now.
embassies.klisk_bad=The Klisks. \n\
We're back. Eroloa tensed up a bit when he found out I did the deal myself. And then he looked like he got doused with salt: apparently, I screwed something up. Yeah... maybe I shouldn't have been such a know-it-all. \n\
All in all, if I need Eroloa's help, I'm screwed. He looks really angry.
embassies.rogues=The Rogues. \n\
The Rogues gave us a pretty warm welcome. Their Mothership is an incredible achievement of their engineering genius. \n\
They seem to be pretty religious and worship something called The Essence of the Devourer. It's still unclear what that is, though. \n\
First contact went over great, they promised to send their ambassador to Earth.
embassies.end=I have visited every civilization. Now I only have to report about it to the brass.


klisk_trade.title=Favor for Eroloa
klisk_trade.start=Well, great, the Klisks are in favor of cooperation. The thing is, Eroloa made it pretty clear that he won't help me just because. So I'll have to do a small favor for him: escort a trade fleet to a remote station. Yeah, it's boring, but I have to do it. \n\
The coordinates of the star system where the station is are ${klisk_trade.coords}
klisk_trade.party=To celebrate the safe flight (why did they even have to hire me?) we docked the ships and organized a little party for our crews. Then I spent some time in the Klisk captain's quarters, we talked about... things. The Klisks are strange, but not impossible to understand.
klisk_trade.refused=We arrived at the station. Just like I thought, Murphy's Law is in full force: the Klisk captain got sick. And until he's well, we can't do the deal and get back. \n\
They offered me to trade in his name, but I refused. Let them find some other haggler. \n\
My work here is done, all I have to do now is report to Eroloa on Kliskada.
klisk_trade.traded=We arrived at the station. Just like I thought, Murphy's Law is in full force: the Klisk captain got sick. I decided not to wait until he's better and do the deal myself. I hope Eroloa's going to be happy with the results. All I have to do now is return to Kliskada and report the results.

energy_sphere.title=The Glowing Sphere
energy_sphere.start=Space is full of wonders. Just the other day something attached itself to the main terminal of our lab. It's some kind of... I think the easiest way to describe that creature is 'a blue glowing sphere.' It's definitely alive, but it doesn't react to us. I don't even think it can feel our presence. Turning off the terminal and physical action didn't help: the terminal charged from the sphere, and all physical objects just pass right through this space wonder!\n\
We need more information... Although there's no hurry: apparently, this creature is harmless.
energy_sphere.klisk=After brokering a meeting between some Klisks and some money, I found out a lot of things about the sphere. This creature is a completely different lifeform, and contacting it is entirely impossible simply because it can't see us and we don't exist as far as it's concerned. It attached itself to the terminal because of... ahem... 'friendship love attachment.' That's a strange description, but that's all I could get out of it. I don't know what to do with it. I could hand over the terminal to an Earthside lab. On the other hand, the sphere is peaceful and harmless, and the terminal has its own power supply now...

translator_device.title=About the Instant Translation Device
translator_device.text=Aurora 1 Captain note: \n\
...I don't get it. We got this device from those who call themselves the Gardeners. It synchronized itself with our science terminal and communication systems, and allowed us to talk with all developed races of the Universe. We can understand them, and they can understand us. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with non-spacefaring races. \n\
 The Gardeners said the device is easy to replicate even with our technology. Of course, it'll be a bit bigger, but it'll work just as well. I hope that's true. \n\
Anyway, get it back to me as soon as you can and try not to break it.

damaged_rogues_scout.title=Damaged Rogue Ship

zorsan_relations.title=Aggressive Negotiations
zorsan_relations.start=I decided to pay the Zorsan a visit, but it all went to hell! They tried to capture me! Why? I have to deal with this ASAP. \n\
The most unpleasant thing here is that they wanted the coordinates of the Earth. I can't let them fall into the hands of the Zorsan!\n\
I'd better ask other races about their reasons for doing it. Or maybe I could intercept a Zorsan courier ship, it's bound to have some information about this. \n\
Apparently, as soon as we went to space we got ourselves a sworn enemy.
zorsan_relations.earth_report=I reported to Earth about the welcome the Zorsan had given me. Just like I had expected, Martan ordered me to make sense of it. It seems like we're about to have our first interstellar war.
zorsan_relations.bork_info=Hm. Kartar Hrrraka, the Bork diplomatic representative, told me a bit about the Zorsan. They're a very belligerent people, they've had their fair share of wars. But why would they want us?
zorsan_relations.war_data=It all makes sense now. \n\
From the data I recovered we found out that the ecology on planet Zorsan is just terrible. The Zorsan have to leave their planet within fifty years, since life there will be impossible by then. Earth is the most similar planet to their homeworld, although it's taken up by humanity. \n\
The worst thing is that the Zorsan don't intend to give us much time. We only have two years before their attack fleet makes it to our system. \n\
I have to report about this to Earth as soon as possible. The future of humanity looks bleak.

zorsan_rebels.title=Contact with the Zorsan
zorsan_rebels.start=A strange courier gave me a message:\n\
 'Hello there, my unwitting comrade in arms. \n\
That's right, I said comrade in arms. Don't be surprised!\n\
When you ruined the plans of the Zorsan government, you showed us what you were made of. You made it clear that you weren't one to trifle with, and I like that. \n\
If you want to find out who I am, get rich, and have some revenge, go to this system: ${zorsan_rebels.start_coords}. Go to the closest planet to the star and look for the place emanating the strongest radio signal. Everything will be explained to you there. \n\
I will understand if you refuse, human captain, but it'll be too bad.'\n\
Weird. I think I should get over there and find out who that mysterious stranger is.

zorsan_rebels.attack=I shouldn't have gone there. A Zorsan ambush was waiting for me at the designated place. First they tried to punk me, when that didn't work they tried to kill me. Well, they didn't.
zorsan_rebels.planet=A Zorsan squad was waiting for me at the designated place. Weird, they all turned out to be friendly. Some kind of... rebels? Freedom fighters? Yeah. They offered cooperation, but to find out the details I have to meet their leader. Even they themselves don't know the exact coordinates, so I'll have to look for him. All I know is that the rebel base is in a red-giant system in Zorsan space.
zorsan_rebels.refused=I found the base, it turned out to be some kind of wandering station. Pretty cool thing. The rebel leader was there and we talked. He didn't give me any details, but now I know what they wanted from me: help with their dirty, bloody business. Of course, I refused. I get enough dirt and blood, I don't need to fight in someone else's war, too.
zorsan_rebels.agreed=I found the base, it turned out to be some kind of wandering station. An interesting structure, but I still prefer the Aurora 2. \n\
Well, then. The rebel leader turned out to be an interesting creature. We talked for a long time. He explained that he respects me because of how well I handled the situation on Zorsan, and because of that he offered me to work for him. It'll be righteous and profitable, but I think I'm going to have to get my hands dirty. \n\
I agreed. After all, the more we screw with the Zorsan, the more probable it is that their invasion will be weakened or even that it's cancelled. \n\
The rebel leader told me to get ready and find them again in about a month.

ftl.title=Faster Than Light
ftl.start=Earth gave me a mission. It's scientific, coming from somewhere in the European Alliance. We have to study a star that's exhibiting unusual activity... yeah. That's not a job for my brains. I think Gordon knows what to do. \n\
The coordinates are ${ftl.coords}.
ftl.run=Everything went bad. The star... It started to blow up just as we approached it. Because of the extension of its gravitational field we can't leave the system. Gordon says we may still have a chance. We just have to follow a gust of solar wind, and we might escape. It's worth trying. We have to try. \n\
This may be my last entry. I could have written more, but I know that if we don't make it, there won't even be solar dust left over from us. So screw it.
ftl.escape=We did it. The lab is throwing a party already, I didn't ban it. I shudder to imagine what is happening in Engineering or the barracks!\n\
It was scary, to find ourselves on the brink of death so suddenly. Space is terrifying, when you think about it. The only thing that saved us was being almost faster than light. What if someday even that is not enough?
ftl.solar_wind.desc=A powerful gust of solar radiation that can be used to boost the ship's speed.
ftl.solar_wind_used=A gust of solar radiation speeds up the ship!
ftl.star.desc=A star on the brink of going supernova. For detailed information we have to assign some scientists to the project in the research screen.
ftl.item.name=Video of a star explosion
ftl.item.desc=Video of a supernova explosion filmed by a ship science crew from extremely close distance. Even aliens can be interested in such materials.

inside.scan_desc=Gordon claims that this might be an entrance to a parallel dimension.
inside.title=Inside
inside.start=We came across some sort of interdimensional rift. Gordon proposes we study it. He claims it's safe. Well, the choice is obvious. The Aurora 2 is a research ship, after all.
inside.enter=Damn it. Some situation we found ourselves in. Turns out studying it wasn't so safe after all, and we got teleported to... some place. Gordon claims that this is a parallel dimension (and this world is a living cell), but I can't bring myself to believe it. After all, everything stayed the same as it was before. \n\
But there's no time for talking about it, we have to act. We need to assess our situation and come up with a way to leave here... if that is even possible.
inside.attacked=We just had our first battle. According to Gordon's report, it's not even close to being the last one. Apparently, to leave here we have to, as he put it, 'increase the local rate of entropy,' although I'm not sure I wrote it down correctly. To put it simply, we have to crush everything we can crush. To be honest, I don't really understand how that will help us leave, but Gordon is the scientist here, he'd know.
inside.end_bad=Gordon was right. We got out. The adventure was exhausting, stupid and pointless. The bits and pieces of data we managed to get studying the portal weren't worth it. Maybe I missed something? No... no, what the hell. I don't even want to think about that.
inside.end_good=Gordon was right. We got out. The adventure was exhausting, although I wouldn't call it completely pointless. I don't know what that thing we got from that strange world is, but something tells me it's valuable. Maybe I'm fooling myself... no! I definitely think everything there happened for a reason.
inside.bio_remains_name=Biomatter from the parallel world


red_meat.title=Mold Onboard
red_meat.start=Our ship got covered with some weird biological gunk. We can't remove it, it grows back too fast. It doesn't seem to pose any threat, Sarah even says that our hull is stronger because of it. But now we can't set foot in populated worlds: if it infects something, it'll bring too many problems. We have to find a way to clean it off before we go back to Earth.
red_meat.discipline=I had to throw Henry and Sarah in the brig for experimenting on the ship without my authorization. Good discipline is a priority on a ship. I hope they understand that. Henry definitely will, I think he even approved of my decision, but I'm not so sure about Sarah.
red_meat.alien_contact=Just like I thought, the aliens refuse to let us in until we clean that gunk off. They definitely know what it is, but the border guards won't even talk to us.
red_meat.cleaned=We finally did it. All we had to do was fly closer to a star and let its radiation burn that mold.
red_meat.burns.1=The solar heat has set the biomass on fire.
red_meat.burns.2=The biomass has burned down completely.

zorsan_battle_after_recon.title=Recon
zorsan_battle_after_recon.start=The Zorsan forces were congregating in a nearby star system before the invasion. We have to go there and see if they have any reserves.
zorsan_battle_after_recon.end=The system is empty. It looks like the Zorsan threw everything they had at us. I have to go back to Earth and report about it.

heritage.title=Heritage
heritage.start=The landing party was attacked by some strange monster. It looks a lot like a Klisk, but it's bigger, stronger, more agressive... What is it? It's weird, not even Gordon and his eggheads managed to find anything out even though they pretty much dismantled the creature to study it. Space really is full of secrets and mysteries. How do I solve this one?
heritage.klisk_refuse=This story turned out to be really exciting! Turns out the monsters like the one that attacked us were developed by some mad scientist from Vortangu Corp. Some Borks shot him later, but he managed to send five of them to live on planets of a certain type. I got an offer to find the four remaining creatures and kill them. But I refused. Like I have nothing better to do. The Aurora 2 isn't a contract killer ship.
heritage.klisk_accept=This story turned out to be really exciting! A certain Lonroe talked to me, some big wig from Vortangu Corp. Turns out the monsters like the one that attacked us were developed by some mad scientist from Vortangu. Some Borks shot him later, but he managed to send five of them to live on planets of a certain type. I got an offer to find the four remaining creatures and kill them. I decided to accept.
heritage.second_monster=We found a monster. It was just as aggressive and angry as the first one. Strange thing: the walls of his cave were covered in some weird letters.
heritage.third_monster=Another monster is dead. Judging by the soldiers' space suit bodycam recordings, the walls of its lair were covered in writing, too. Some random words, but it was definitely in Klisk. This mission just became a bit weirder...
heritage.fourth_monster=We found the fourth creature. We didn't have to kill it: it had killed itself a long time before we came, its body had time to mummify itself. The walls were covered in random word salad. And they rhymed. The monster had been trying to write poetry. Who the hell are we hunting?!
heritage.fifth_monster=Fifth and final monster. It greeted my soldiers with poetry, and they couldn't kill it. We took it aboard the Aurora 2 alive. I talked to it. It's a very strange creature.
Something is obviously wrong with its head, but its speech is coherent and intelligent. Sometimes it acts like a child, and sometimes its behavior is that of a smart, even developed Klisk. What do I do with it? I still haven't decided.
heritage.end_give_to_klisk=That's it, it's finally over. I handed over the bodies and the live monster to the Vortangu representative. He gave me a hefty bonus for the latter. Well, at least I didn't end up flying all over the galaxy for nothing.
heritage.end_save_lie=That's it, it's finally over. I handed over the bodies to the Vortangu representative, but I kept the live monster on my ship. I had to lie. Otherwise Lonroe wouldn't like my decision.

heritage.end_save=That's it, it's finally over. I handed over the bodies to the Vortangu representative, but I kept the live monster on my ship. I told Lonroe the truth: that I can't hand over a living being to some corporation. Oh. Watching his fat mug was something else. I thought his cheeks were going to burst right before my camera. It was funny, sure, but I'm afraid telling the truth might mean trouble in the future...
heritage.corpse_desc=The body of a strange monster that distantly resembles a Klisk.
heritage.corpse_name=Dead mutant Klisk.

quarantine.title=Quarantine
quarantine.crewmember_dies=A crew member died from an unknown disease.
quarantine.start=Gordon told me someone from his team died. The supposed cause of death is getting infected by an alien animal. This is very alarming news. \n We are checking every crew member.
quarantine.confirmed=The situation has gotten worse. It looks like we really are all infected and this disease is fatal... We have to find a cure. We can probably synthesize it ourselves, but we don't have enough data. We need samples from the planet the sick animal came from. Or... we could probably buy the medicine? \n The important thing is not to go back to Earth until we know what this disease is and how dangerous it can be for humanity.
quarantine.medbay=It's a good thing we have a great medbay onboard. It will help the infected hold out for a bit longer while we're looking for the cure.
quarantine.biodata=It's lucky that we had bought biological data from the aliens before this happened. Gordon claims that there's data about diseases capable of infecting specimens from different planets among the information there. According to him, this data will speed up our search for the vaccine greatly.
quarantine.klisk_buy=I bought the formula of the cure from the Klisks. It wasn't cheap, but you don't skimp out on things like this.
quarantine.klisk_get=The Klisks gave me the medicine for free. It's good to have friends like that.
quarantine.medicine=We went back to the right planet and took the specimens we needed. Now we can synthesize the cure.
quarantine.end=The disease is defeated and we can go back. A bit more and the vastness of space would have one more abandoned ship in it.
quarantine.solar_system=We can't go home until we neutralize the infection.
quarantine.star_system_mark=Deadly virus that infected the whole crew originates from this star system.

tutorial.title=Tutorial
tutorial.start=Okay, so they gave me a simple mission to check the ship's systems. I have to get to Mars, destroy a ship called the Space Rogue there, then land on the planet, shoot down an autonomous drone and collect its debris. In it will be its black box, I'll have to hand it over to our scientists so that they break the code and get the code phrase. I'll have to tell the phrase to Martan.
tutorial.drone_landed=Before it blew up, a descent vehicle deployed from the ship and landed on Mars.
tutorial.ship_destroyed=Destroying the ship wasn't hard, all combat systems of the Aurora work well. But those geniuses should have been more careful with arming our mark, someone could have gotten hurt.
tutorial.drone_collected=I handed over what was left of the drone to the scientists. Now I have to assign project leaders and wait for the results.
tutorial.end=Key phrase obtained. Martan is a funny guy.
tutorial.drone_data.name=Test drone debris
tutorial.scan_desc=This is an old decommissioned cargo ship Space Rogue, our target practice. You can see the holes in its hull where all working equipment was taken off of it.

sentient_stone.title=TBD
sentient_stone.name=Strange stone
sentient_stone.desc=It looks like a stone but our scanners show that it is a live being.
sentient_stone.charging=Stone is preparing to attack!
sentient_stone.attack=Stone rushes forward crushing everything in its way!
sentient_stone.party_damaged=Powerful blow scatters scientists!
sentient_stone.start=So strange... our landing party did not find any living creatures, it seems like our scanner reacts to the stones! Should take \
some of them for analysis.
sentient_stone.incident=Emergency! Suddenly the stone that we brought on board started moving and crushed our lab! We moved it into the cargo bay and it is rolling there and crushing walls. \
  Should decide what to do with it.
sentient_stone.throw_to_space=The stone was extremely dangerous so I decided to throw it into space. We can not afford any more incidents that threaten the ship safety.
sentient_stone.stunned=Stone is stunned by shots
sentient_stone.after_klisk=The Klisks helped us to contact this stone... it is really sentient. The conversation was quite unusual and klisk translator \
  barely manages to translate. To improve our communication we must teach this stone and also learn from him. Should spare some time for that.
sentient_stone.end=So that is it. The stone... it... or 'she' to be exact, has improved its communication skills and speaks now almost as a human adult.\n\
She wanted us to leave her in open space so she could live there and explore it for that eternity of life she has.\n\
  I do not know if I will miss her but anyway this was a great experience for us.\n\
  Gordon says they collected a lot of useful data so I believe people on Earth will be glad, despite not very good beginning of this contact.

family_problems.ship_looted=Some resources and alien goods looted from the bork ship.
