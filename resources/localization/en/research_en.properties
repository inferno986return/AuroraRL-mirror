animal.default_name=Unknown alien animal

probe.name=Probe data decoding
probe.desc=Decoding data from probe storage. It can contain scientific data, as well as some information on its mothership location and progress
probe.astro_data_retrieved=Retrieved %d astro data from probe
probe.report=After decoding data from probe storage we have learned some information about Aurora route.\n\
The last record was mentioning that they had searched stars nearby and found nothing interesting, and they were planning to make a long jump to sector after [50, 10] and explore that part of space. \n\
In addition probe storage contained some ship log messages and a backup copy of work done by Aurora science team. There is nothing really valuable for us there, but it will be useful for researches on Earth.
probe.scan_description=This is a probe #XNA-12 from Aurora vessel. According to telemetry data, it is functioning properly and is awaiting orders.

beacon.name=Beacon research
beacon.desc=Detailed study for materials and samples taken from enormous alien structure, assigned name 'beacon'
beacon.report=This structure is located near the sun, consuming its energy and transforming it into emiision of different types of waves, both radio and hyperwave. It is transmitting a small, repeatable pattern, and its power is enormous. We believe it can be easily detected even with our low-resolution sensors from more than a thousand light years. Due to these points we believe that this structure is some kind of a beacon, perhaps used for navigation, or for marking places of interest for its creators. \n\
We din't fully understand mechanincs of its emission and energy consumption, but it overpowers all technology available to humanity. Detailed study of collected data in Earth laboratories can lead to a breakthrough in high-energy and hyperwave physics.\n\
We should also be careful, as creators of this beacon may not welcome our violation of their territory.

obliterator_klisk.name=Obliterator
obliterator_klisk.desc=Study of materials provided by Klisk race about origin of 'twin' star systems. Contains huge text, image and video archives.
obliterator_klisk.report=First section of processed data tells about an ancient 'Builder' race. This was an advanced civilisation that has created a lot of huge astroengineering structures in galaxy. There ary Dyson spheres, artificial planets and others, their coordinates are mentioned in data, so we may visit them and examine them ourselves. \n\
Builders have disappeared from this Galaxy centuries ago, leaving everything they have created. And among their creations there were some really dangerous toys. \n\
One of them is known as 'Obliterator'. It is hard to believe that such enormous spaceship really exists. \n\
Obliterator is some kind of automated terraforming ship. But it transforms not only planets, but star systems themselves, including stars, satellites and other celestial bodies, making all systems look the same, according to a given template. This is how these 'twin systems' are born. [Remark from Godon 'Ha, I was right about their origin, captain!'] \n\
Obliterator seems to have no general purpose, it just follows its program and travels across galaxy, transforming all systems it meets on its way. \n\
Its current coordinates are well-known, and we should probably go and look at it. Research project has been added for that purpose. \n\
Though most probably we won't receive any new information. Records state that Builders technology is completely invulnerable, so we won't be able to sneak inside, or to chop off a piece for detailed study. All such attempts, done by other civilisations for past millennium, have failed.

astronomy.name=Astronomy
astronomy.desc=Scan and explore space objects in current star system: build navigation maps, celestial bodies catalog and sailing directions
astronomy.all_data_collected=All astronomy data collected for this star system
astronomy.paused=Research paused, no suitable celestial bodies nearby
astronomy.status="Remaining %d astro data for this star system, %f days to finish"

weapon_test.name='Big Mommy' weapons test
weapon_test.desc=Test of the most powerful weapon humanity can create against Obliterator. If even this enormous bomb, that can crack Earth into pieces, won't be able to do any major damage, then Earth is completely defenceless against this threat.
weapon_test.report=Our most powerful weapon failed to inflict any major damage to alien structure. In fact, it failed to inflict any damage at all. As if it were just a flashlight, and not the devastating weapon.
weapon_test.paused=Should be within same star system as Obliterator

artifact.name=Artifact research
artifact.desc=Study for an alien artifact. Different physical and chemical tests for its condition, contents and materials

animal.name=Biology research for
animal.desc=A set of tasks for researching alien animal. Autopsy, chemical and biological tests etc.

cartography.name=Cartography
cartography.desc=Processing of raw geological data received from sensors and converting it into its final and usable form, such as terrain maps
cartography.status=Remaining raw geodata: %d, est. %s days left

star_exploration.name=Star exploration at [%d,%d]
star_exploration.desc=Collecting of detailed data about anomalous star in specific star system, located at given star coordinates. In order to perform measurements, starship must stay close to star.

space_object.wrong_system=Must be in specific star system
space_object.too_far=Must be closer to object
space_object.progress=Processing, remaining data:

brown_dwarf.report=This brown dwarf is unusual, as it actively emits radiowaves. Origin of this emission is currently unclear, and it is changing in time in a way that breaks all current theories concerning brown dwarves structure. \n\
This star is small, and its surface temperature is only about 900K, which makes it look more like a gas giant than like a star. Tracking such stars from Solar system using long-range radio telescopes is very difficult due to their low contrast and great distance.\
Data collected by expedition can lead to better understanding of processes occurring inside these 'wannabe-stars'. But for better process understanding we should find and observe another brown dwarf with similar emission capacity. The closest one is at [12, 12]

brown_dwarf_2.report=We have studied the star, but it is not emitting anything unusual this time. It is a typical brown dwarf of spectral class L, its optical spectrum dominated by absorption bands of FeH, CrH and prominent alkali metal lines.\n\
Perhaps, the source of emission is that alien structure near it. But what an immense power should it contain then? We should investigate this as soon as possible
