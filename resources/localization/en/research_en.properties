animal.default_name=Unknown alien animal

probe.name=Probe data decoding
probe.astro_data_retrieved=Retrieved %d astro data from probe
probe.desc=Decoding data from probe storage. It may contain scientific data, \
as well as some information on its mothership location and progress
probe.report=After decoding the data from the probe storage, we have learned some information about the flight plan of the Aurora. \n\
The last record mentioned that they had searched stars nearby and found nothing of interest, \
and they were planning to make a long jump to sector [50, 10] and explore that part of space. \n\
In addition, the probe storage contained some ship log messages and a backup copy \
of the research performed by Aurora science team. \
There is nothing really valuable for us there, but it will be useful for research on Earth.
probe.scan_description=This is a #XNA-12 probe from the Aurora vessel. \
According to telemetry data, it is functioning properly and is awaiting orders.

beacon.name=Beacon research
beacon.desc=In-depth study of the materials and samples taken from an enormous alien structure dubbed 'The Beacon.'
beacon.report=This structure is orbiting a sun, consuming its energy and emitting it as different types of waves, \
both radio and hyperwave. It is transmitting a short repeating pattern, and its power is enormous. \
We believe it our low-resolution sensors can easily detect it from more than a thousand light years away. \
Because to these facts, we believe that this structure is some kind of a beacon, \
perhaps used for navigation, or for marking places of interest for its creators. \n\
We din't fully understand the mechanincs of its emission and energy consumption, \
but it outclasses all technology available to humanity. \
An in-depth study of the collected data at Earth-side laboratories can lead to a breakthrough \
in high-energy and hyperwave physics.\n\
We should also be careful, as creators of this beacon may not welcome our violation of their territory.

obliterator_klisk.name=The Obliterator
obliterator_klisk.desc=Study of the materials provided by the Klisk race about the origin of 'twin' star systems. \
Contains huge amounts of text, image and video archives.
obliterator_klisk.report=First section of processed data tells us about an ancient Builder race. \
This was an advanced civilisation that created a lot of huge astroengineering structures in the galaxy. \
There are Dyson spheres, artificial planets and more; their coordinates are mentioned in the data, \
so we may visit them and examine them ourselves. \n\
Builders disappeared from this Galaxy centuries ago, leaving everything they had created behind them. \
There were some really dangerous toys among their creations. \n\
One of them is known as The Obliterator. It is hard to believe that such an enormous spaceship could really exist. \n\
The Obliterator is some kind of an automated terraforming ship. But it transforms not only planets, \
but even the star systems themselves, \
including stars, satellites and other celestial bodies, making all systems look the same, according to the given template. \
This is how these 'twin systems' are born. [GORDON'S NOTE: 'Hah, I was right about their origin, captain!'] \n\
The Obliterator seems to have no general purpose, it just follows its programming and moves around the galaxy, \
transforming all systems it meets on the way. \n\
Its current coordinates are well-known, and we should probably go and look at it. \
A research project has been added for that purpose. \n\
Although, most probably we won't receive any new information. \
Records state that the Builders technology is completely impregnable, so we won't be able to sneak inside, \
or to chop off a piece for detailed study. All such attempts, done by other civilisations for past millennium, have failed.

astronomy.name=Astronomy
astronomy.desc=Scanning and exploration of space objects in the current star system: \

astronomy.paused=Research paused, no suitable celestial bodies nearby
astronomy.status="%d astro data suitable for research left in this star system, %f days to finish"

weapon_test.name='Big Mommy' weapons test
weapon_test.desc=Test of the most powerful weapon humanity was able to create against The Obliterator. \
If not even this enormous bomb capable of breaking Earth into pieces can't do any major damage, \
then Earth is completely defenseless against this threat.
weapon_test.report=Our most powerful weapon failed to inflict any major damage to the alien structure. \
In fact, it failed to inflict any damage at all. As if it were just a flashlight, and not a devastating weapon.
weapon_test.paused=You must be within same star system as The Obliterator

artifact.name=Artifact research
artifact.desc=Study of an alien artifact. Different physical and chemical tests of its condition, contents and materials

space_object.too_far=Must be closer to object
space_object.progress=Processing, remaining data:

brown_dwarf.report=This brown dwarf is unusual, as it actively emits radiowaves. \
The origin of this emission is currently unclear, and it is changing in time in a way that breaks all current theories \
concerning the structure of brown dwarves. \n\
This star is small, and its surface temperature is only about 900K, which makes it look more like a gas giant than \
a star. Tracking such stars from the Solar system using long-range radio telescopes is very difficult \
due to their low contrast and great distance. \
Data collected by an expedition can lead to better understanding of processes occurring inside these 'wannabe-stars'. \
But for better process understanding we should find and observe another brown dwarf with similar emission capacity.

brown_dwarf_2.report=We have studied the star, but it is not emitting anything unusual at this time. \
It is a typical spectral class L brown dwarf, its optical spectrum dominated by absorption bands of FeH, CrH \
and prominent alkali metal lines.\n\
Perhaps the source of emission is that alien structure near it. \
But what immense power it would contain then? We should investigate this as soon as possible.

builder_ruins.report=This is an ancient building, a remnant of some old civilisation. \
Time and weather have eroded most of it, only a few corroded pieces of metal and stone remain. \
Analysis indicates that it is at least thousand years old. It is impossible to understand now what was it was built for.

klisk_banner.report=This artifact represents a platinum plate with an engraved message on it. \
Based on our knowlege of the Klisk language, we could decipher it partially. \
It seems to tell the story of the first nation to reach another planet in their home system. \
Similar plates were sent by the humanity to the Moon and Mars along with the first probes that reached those celestial bodies. \n\
It is purely a memorial plaque and posesses little scientific interest. \
However, it might be a useful tool in learning the Klisk language and culture \
when Earth linguists and xenopshycologists have deciphered it completely.

race_research.report=Finished studying materials about an alien race. A short summary was added to the codex.

rogues.name=Data on the Rogues
rogues.desc=Study of the data provided by a Klisk trader about the Rogues race

bork.name=Materials on the Borks
bork.desc=Study of the data provided by a Klisk trader about the Rogues race

klisk.name=Materials on the Klisks
klisk.desc=Study of the data provided by a Klisk trader about the Rogues race

zorsan.name=Materials on the Zorsan
zorsan.desc=Study of the data provided by a Klisk trader about the Rogues race

zorsan_war_data.name=Decoding Zorsan data
zorsan_war_data.desc=Decoding and study of the data retrieved from the crash site  of a destroyed Zorsan battleship.
zorsan_war_data.report=We were able to partially decode the tactical data and news about fleet movements, \
military orders and other similar documents over the last few months.\n\
It seems like our first skirmish with the Zorsan had a much bigger resonance than what we had expected. \
All of their ships were briefed about us and ordered to capture or destroy us at any cost.\n\
But that isn't the most important thing. Somehow they managed to find the approximate area of space \
that we came from! Their fleet has been brought to advanced alert status, they've sent out scounts \
to find our homeworld! Captain, they're preparing a massive invasion, and it's only a matter of time \
before they find us.\n\
We have to warn Earth about this urgently and get our defense ready.\n\
According to our estimates, the Zorsan will need from 18 to 24 months to find out where Earth is'
and prepare their invasion force.

captured_rogues.name=Rogues research
captured_rogues.desc=Study of the Rogues present aboard the ship. Psychological and biological tests, \
regular conversations about different subjects. Collecting all possible information.
captured_rogues.report=The Rogues turned out to be pretty talkative. They refused to share any secrets about their technology\
(or maybe they just didn't know anything useful about the inner workings of their devices), but they were happy to tell us \
a lot of things about their culture and history. The summary of the interrogation has been added to the dossier.\n\
In adddition, a number of psychological tests were carried out; the results may be of interest to many Earth scientists, \
as it may facilitate an understanding of how these aliens think.\n\
Our capabilities in studying their biological structure were limited by our unwillingness to harm them.\
However, the main characteristics of their anatomy were studied and noted down.

zorsan_crew_weapons.name=Captured Zorsan weapons research
zorsan_crew_weapons.desc=We have come across several hand-carried Zorsan weapons. \
In principle, it resembles our laser weaponry, but it is more powerful and accurate.\n\
After studying the weapons, we may be able to upgrade the weaponry on our ship, \
and also find new ways of focusing our lasers and increasing their efficiency, \
which might prove useful on Earth.
zorsan_crew_weapons.report=After studying the captured weaponry, we know more about focusing our lasers \
and increasing their efficiency. Our engineers are now able to supply our landing party with these weapons.\n\
A group of scientists has developed a new theory of inducing emissions using materials that have never been used \
for this purpose before, which may trigger a revolution in industry and technology.

parallel_world_bio_data.name=Research into organics from the parallel world
parallel_world_bio_data.desc=A study of the stem organics retrieved during the period where the Aurora 2 \
was forced to operate in a parallel world.
parallel_world_bio_data.report=The organics samples we gathered turned out to be, oddly enough, garden variety stem cells. \
Despite its alien origins, these biomaterials aren't clearly differentiated, so by using certain\
genome manipulations they easily integrate themselves into various biological segments and replace them, \
exhibiting high speed and efficiency during the replacement.\n\
Unfortunately, as tests with lab animals showed, chronic illnesses can't be cured that way \
as the undifferentiated stem cells morph into cells that are already infected. \
However, in the case of common injuries (even rather serious ones, according to our tests), \
using the stem biomass has proved highly effective: the wounds are healed right before your eyes!

red_meat.name=Mysterious biomass
red_meat.desc=Research into the biomass fragments attached to the outer hull of the Aurora 2
red_meat.report=Subject name: Biomass X1X\n\
Subject properties: active regeneration, capability to sustain life in outer space\n\
Outcome of experiment: failure\n\
\n\
Head Scientists's personal comment: "Captain, I told you the subject was highly complex,\
but in the end we were able to dissect it. However, doing it didn't help us in any way. \
We were only able to get its most elemental components, the analysis of which didn't provide us the key\
to unlocking the mechanisms that grant the creature such amazing resilience.\
We should hand over what is left of the material to the Project Aurora labs on Earth, \
maybe that will give us some results."\n\
The biomass is susceptible to thermal action. Small fragments of it can be destroyed using fire or lasers, \
but larger parts regenerate too quickly. We need considerable heat over the entire surface to destroy it completely,\
but there is no equipment on the ship capable of generating such heat over the entirety of the outer hull.

alien_math.name=Alien math
alien_math.desc=A large amount of data on the fundamentals of alien math. \
Its value is primarily theoretic for the scientists on Earth.
alien_biology.name=Alien biology
alien_biology.desc=A large amount of data on the fundamentals of alien biology. \
Its value is primarily theoretic for the scientists on Earth.
alien_physics.name=Alien physics
alien_physics.desc=A large amount of data on the fundamentals of alien physics.\
All of the general theories that human science has been trying to construct \
in the last hundred years. Its value is primarily theoretic for the scientists on Earth.
alien_chemistry.name=Alien chemistry
alien_chemistry.desc=A large amount of chemistry data. Contains laws of substance interactions \
and chemical reactions. Its value is primarily theoretic for the scientists on Earth.

energy_concentration.name=Energy concentration
energy_concentration.desc=A set of technologies for power generation and manipulation
energy_concentration.report=We have studied the technologies. It definitely can lead to a breakthrough \
in high-energy and hyperwave physics. There is a lot of data from optimal antenna shapes for energy transmission to new ways of manipulating magnetic fields yet unknown by our science.\n\
This can help developing new power sources and probably resolve the Earth energy crysis.

loot.computers.name=Alien computers
loot.computers.desc=Study of the captured alien computing equipment
loot.computers.report=Experiments with the functioning items have yielded impressive results: \
the computing capabilities of alien computers is much higher than ours in some aspects, \
since it is based on a different type of algorhythmic calculations! \n\
Applied research has shown that spare parts left over from completely different alien ships \
are still pretty similar in terms of internal (and to a lesser extent, external) architecture. \
It is obvious that all alien computer technology, from the Borks to the Zorsan, \
are built according to the same principles. This will make their integration into \
the working system of the Aurora 2 easier, and minimize the risk of unfortunate incidents.

loot.energy.name=Alien energy
loot.energy.desc=Study of the captured alien energy devices
loot.energy.report=We have studied various devices used to generate, \
store, and manipulate energy. They utilize many interesting solutions yet unknown on Earth, \
but, in general, the basic principles are the same as with our tech.\n\
Despite this similarity, it is possible that we will not be able to engineer devices \
even approaching these in terms of energy effectiveness any time soon.

loot.materials.name=Alien materials
loot.materials.desc=Study of the captured alien alloys and materials
loot.materials.report=We still haven't been able to figure out how the most interesting \
of the materials we've looked at were created: our technological chain has nothing \
that could cause such transformations of matter. \n\
However, we did learn something, and a couple of technological solutions \
we've picked up will allow us to manufacture stronger armor.

loot.weaponry.name=Alien weapons
loot.weaponry.desc=Study of the fragments of captured weapons
loot.weaponry.report=Unfortunately, we were unable to fully reproduce any piece of weaponry, \
but we have learned a lot about the physical principles it is based on, \
and about the workings of alien guidance systems.

loot.goods.name=Alien goods
loot.goods.desc=Study of various alien civilian goods
loot.goods.report=We've had everything fall into our hands, from furniture to entertainment \
systems to art pieces. Nothing particularly useful to us, but it will give xenopsychologists \
on Earth a lot to work with. All the major museums will probably get into a fight over these \
items.

colony.monsters.name=Data on the monsters from the colonists
colony.monsters.desc=A plethora of data about the aggressive fauna that inhabits \
the colonized planet. Samples, fragments, autopsy reports, video recordings, \
and witness statements.\n\
Apparently, the colonists gather this data faster than they can deal with it. \
We can make it look presentable and send it to Earth.

quarantine_medicine.name=Medicine
quarantine_medicine.desc=Examination of collected samples that may help cure the unknown deadly disease that has infected the crew.
tutorial_research.name=Cracking the code
tutorial_research.desc=Cracking the encoding of the data from the black box of the destroyed drone in order to get the key phrase needed to finish the test mission.


sentient_stone.name=Sentient stone
sentient_stone.desc=Results of experiments and communication with sentient stone
