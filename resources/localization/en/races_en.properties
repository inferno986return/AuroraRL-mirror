Klisk.homeworld.description=<Klisk homeworld>\n\
The planet surface is a huge desert without any traces of water that looks uninhabitable,\
although even from space you can see city lights in in several depressions in the planetary crust.\
These giant holes look like meteor impact craters; inside them are city blocks that are significantly\
larger than any city on Earth.\n\
There is a Cyclopean structure floating in the circumplanetary space above the equator.\n\
Its biggest section, which is next to neutral point L1, could be some kind of shipyard.\n\
GORDON'S NOTE: Apparently, the Klisks are a subterranean species, otherwise they wouldn't have\
developed as fast as they did in a desert.

Humans.homeworld.description=<Earth>\n\
Earth defence systems detected unauthorised surface scanning.\n\
Signatures are recognized as beloning to the Aurora project ship.\n\
Humanity gives the brave explorers a warm welcome!

Humans.colony.title=Humanity colony

Humans.colony.description=TBD

Rogues.mothership.description=A gargantuan ship developed using unknown technology.\
It is almost impervious to scanning. The only things you can make out are\
incredible quantities of circulating energy and lots of lifeforms onboard.\n\
GORDON'S NOTE: I am amazed. How did they manage to build THAT? We have to make friends with a species like that.

Bork.homeworld.description=<Sypsia>\n\
This planet's water resources prevail over the land (60%). The atmosphere is oxygen-based,\
suitable for breathing by humans. In some parts of the two continents there is a lot of\
spontaneous natural vegetation. The scan revealed low levels of natural radiation,\
but the readings are anomalously high in the capital city.\n\
GORDON'S NOTE: I'm no evolutionist, but I think it's obvious that this isn't the Bork homeworld.

Zorsan.homeworld.description=<Zorsan>\
Scanning reveals the planet's great age and resource depletion. Caustobiolithic deposits are dry.\
There is next to know natural vegetation. The industry is incredibly developed, which,\
supposedly, is the reason for the planet's state.\n\
GORDON'S NOTE: We weren't able to scan the businesses and factories, they are well-shielded.\
Deep scanning revealed some odd tectonic irregularities in the planet's depths.\
It seems that while we need a colony, the Zorsan need a completely new home.
