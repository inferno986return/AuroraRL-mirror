intro_1.1.text=They won't come back. It was clear even a month ago, but now it's too obvious to ignore the fact that our most ambitious project has failed.

intro_1.5.text=There is a way. We've got more advanced technologies than a few years ago and we don't have to create the project from scratch. The spaceship will be smaller, but we will use all our experience from the previous project to improve this one. Thus, it will be properly prepared for its mission.
intro_1.2.text=Despite the fact that the first journey brought us several interesting samples, our Union bore great losses, we lost about one hundred billion dollars! You all have seen the reports! There is also a decrease in the index of population happiness. There was nothing like this for fifty years already, since those events in Africa.

intro_1.3.text=Have you seen the Aurora-2 project? If you refuse to explore space, the things might become even more complicated. We literally have no choice! Sure, we can try annexing the rest of the independent suppliers or continue sticking to our current politics, but it will help only in a short run. However, we will suffer the consequences of this decision within 10 or 15 years. I consider that the wisest decision is to develop this project. We can find everything we need in space. All we need is look for it. You have seen the results of Aurora-1, you know I'm right.

intro_1.7.text=According to our reports, there is only one Alliance that have enough money to finance the main part of the project. Obviously, they will have all rights to take the majority of income that Aurora-2 will bring. If it bring any, of course. And I think you all know, about whom I'm talking about...
intro_1.4.text=There is no way we will build this spaceship in the situation at hand. There is no money in our treasure and the recourses are exhausted. There are a lot of people, plain citizens and even politicians, who think that we are uselessly wasting our money on a this spaceship project, while they can help those region that have need in energy or food supplies.
