enterprise.0=Look who is there. Glad to see you. Do you want anything special, or just visiting your old commander?
enterprise.0.any_interesting=Have you seen anything interesting nearby?
enterprise.0.assist=We need your assistance.
enterprise.0.end=No, nothing special, was just passing by.
enterprise.1=No, nothing special. Usual mad alien stuff.
enterprise.1.end=Ok then.
enterprise.2=What do you need?
enterprise.2.repair=Our ship is damaged, can you spare some resources and engineers to help fixing it?
enterprise.2.nothing=Actually nothing, I was wrong.
enterprise.3=Sure. Humans must help each other in this vast void.
enterprise.3.end=<over>

game_start.0=That's it, we have finally left Solar system. My team is anticipating beginning research of everything new we will find! Hope you will not make us wait for long, captain.
game_start.0.next=What do you think we shall do now?
game_start.0.end=Sure, I will not allow your department to sit idle and play video games for much more. <Skip this tutorial>
game_start.1=Well, we should travel now to some other star system and begin exploring it as soon as possible. \n <Use arrow keys to move ship, Enter to enter star system>. \n You can also observe list of tasks that are given to us by Earth science society \n <Press 'r' to open research screen>
game_start.1.next=And what do you believe is the best way to explore a star system?
game_start.1.end=Yes, that's exactly what I was about to do. Let's start our journey.
game_start.2=Each star system has a lot to explore. While staying in space, we can scan it, collect information about celestial bodies and build space map. In your Research panel, this is called 'Astronomy research'. It is available in any star system. Also you can send landing parties to planets and artificial space structures to explore them.
game_start.2.next=And what we can do on planets?
game_start.2.end=Well, just as I expected. Just wanted to be sure that we have same ideas about means of exploration.
game_start.3=Is this some kind of exam, captain? Landing parties on planets can explore surface and build maps, collect resources, explore alien animals and artifacts, if found.
game_start.3.end=Yeah, was just checking if our ideas about means of exploration are the same. Now let's start our business.

rogue_scout.main.0=Assistance is required.
rogue_scout.main.0.next=What has happend to your ship?
rogue_scout.main.0.end=Sorry, no time for this.
rogue_scout.main.1=Attacked by Klisk raider. Managed to blow it up. Suffered critical damage. Require resources to repair engines.
rogue_scout.main.1.next=How much do you need?
rogue_scout.main.1.end=Sorry, we can not spare resources.
rogue_scout.main.2=5 units will be enough. Engines will start and journey will continue.
rogue_scout.main.2.help=We will gladly help you. Prepare for transfer.
rogue_scout.main.2.price=And what we will get in return?
rogue_scout.main.2.end=Sorry, we do not have enough.
rogue_scout.main.3=Nothing is free in this world. Some Klisk credits available. Will pay you 5 credits. Nothing more left. Usually do not exchange valuable credits for raw resources, but special circumstances here.
rogue_scout.main.3.help=One credit for one resource unit? I like your way of doing business. We accept.
rogue_scout.main.3.not_enough=No, that's not enough.
rogue_scout.main.3.sell=Not too much for your lives. I guess we can get more if just tell Klisk about your location.
rogue_scout.main.4=Nothing more valuable left on this ship.
rogue_scout.main.4.help=All right, we accept your offer but only because of pure kindness.
rogue_scout.main.4.end=Then you are just out of luck. Over.
rogue_scout.main.4.sell=Not too much for your lives. I guess we can get more if just tell Klisk about your location.
rogue_scout.main.5=It is possible. Preparations will be done for that case. <Alien ship cuts communication>
rogue_scout.main.5.end=<over>

obliterator_warning_1.0=Captain, we have urgent news for you.
obliterator_warning_1.0.next=What has happened?
obliterator_warning_1.1=We have analyzed the data you have collected about that huge Obliterator ship
obliterator_warning_1.1.next=You have never been so taciturn before. What have you discovered? Obliterator is coming to Earth tomorrow, heh?
obliterator_warning_1.2=Actually it does.
obliterator_warning_1.2.next=WHAT?!
obliterator_warning_1.3=Not tomorrow, of course, but within next 10 years. Look at our report based on materials you collected.
obliterator_warning_1.3.next=You must be kidding...

obliterator_warning_2.0=You understand, that this information should not be made public? It can lead to a planet-scale panic, and we can not afford that.
obliterator_warning_2.0.next=Yes, i understand. You... do you have any plan? What shall we do?
obliterator_warning_2.1=We are working on it. Currently we need more information about this Obliterator and previous attempts to stop it. We must learn if somebody has ever managed to inflict major damage to this ship.
obliterator_warning_2.1.destroy=You think we will be able to destroy it?
obliterator_warning_2.1.evac=I doubt that we have enough power to even scratch it. We should perform an evacuation to another star system. Save what we can.
obliterator_warning_2.2=We should try. We are now loading your ship with Big Mom - the biggest nuclear bomb ever created. It is powerful enough even to crack Earth into pieces. Your goal is to fire it at Obliterator and review the results.
obliterator_warning_2.2.next=You think it is powerful enough?
obliterator_warning_2.3=We will see. If it manages to inflict at least some damage, for next years we will build much more of these and blow that damn vessel up. If not... then at our current level of technology we are defenseless against it.
obliterator_warning_2.3.progress=We have progressed greatly for the past few years, mostly because of Aurora project. May be we will find a weapon, a technology that can destroy Obliterator if search for just some more time?
obliterator_warning_2.3.evac=What shall we do then? Run?
obliterator_warning_2.4=Maybe. Currently we are working on a backup plan for evacuating solar system. When it will be completed, your ship will be commandeered and used as a transport. We have too little hyperspace-capable ships, so we will use all we have. Until then you will continue your search.
obliterator_warning_2.4.new_ships=What about constructing new ships?
obliterator_warning_2.4.aliens=Maybe aliens can help us?
obliterator_warning_2.5=We will start building new ships as soon as possible. But our capabilities are restricted by our current level of technology, we can not produce hyperspace cores fast.
obliterator_warning_2.5.aliens=Maybe aliens can help us?
obliterator_warning_2.6=That would be very good if they spare some of their ships to help with evacuation or fighting with Obliterator. However, most likely they will demand payment, and we have little to offer them.
obliterator_warning_2.6.next=So what exactly shall we do now?
obliterator_warning_2.7=We will work on evacuation plans now and send first ships with colonists as soon as possible. You will have 3 main goals: \n 1) Test our weapon against Obliterator \n 2) Collect information and technology that will help us destroy it or escape from it \n 3) Find allies that will assist us in saving humanity \n And let the God help us all.
obliterator_warning_2.7.end=I will do my best

obliterator_encountered.0=Oh my god, captain, look at this
obliterator_encountered.0.knows=Is this that Obliterator stuff?
obliterator_encountered.0.not_knows=What the hell is that thing?
obliterator_encountered.1=Looks like that. I have seen its images, but to see it with own eyes... I can't imagine power of civilization that has built this
obliterator_encountered.1.end=We will stay here for some time and study it
obliterator_encountered.2=I do not know... I can't even imagine how it can exist. It's greater than the sun! Its half of a system size! Oh my god...
obliterator_encountered.2.end=We will stay here for some time and study it

second_cloned_system_found.0=Captain, there is something... strange about this star system, though we are not really sure...
second_cloned_system_found.0.ask=Strange? What do you mean?
second_cloned_system_found.0.guess=I see nothing strange about this star system, with except of that it is strangely similar to one we have visited before
second_cloned_system_found.1=According to our observations, this system is absolutely identical to one we have visited before. Number and size of planets, satellites, their orbits - everything is the same! Looks like these two systems has been done on the same conveyor, literally
second_cloned_system_found.1.next=And why is it a problem?
second_cloned_system_found.2=I am impressed. Yes, that is the problem. this system is absolutely identical to one we have visited before. Number and size of planets, satellites, their orbits - everything is the same!
second_cloned_system_found.2.next=And why is it a problem?
second_cloned_system_found.3=Such grade of similarity is virtually impossible! We have seen many stars and planets, some are similar, some are different, but none are absolutely identical! This could not have happened naturally!
second_cloned_system_found.3.random=Well, you tend to forget the basics of probability theory: even the most less-probable event actually MAY happen, Gordon
second_cloned_system_found.3.artificial=So you think this is a result of some kind of sapient work?
second_cloned_system_found.4=Of course theoretically you are right, but i'd rather believe these systems ware created by some super-powerful alien race, than that they had originated independently and naturally
second_cloned_system_found.4.next=Ok, we will investigate that.
second_cloned_system_found.5=Yes, this is most simple and obvious answer. Some kind of system-wide terraforming, or something like that. Or maybe just some alien 'stone garden'.
second_cloned_system_found.5.next=Ok, we will investigate that.
second_cloned_system_found.6=Of course theoretically you are right, but i'd rather believe these systems ware created by some super-powerful alien race, than that they had originated independently and naturally
second_cloned_system_found.6.next=Ok, we will investigate that.

third_cloned_system_found.0=Captain, guess what? This is another 'twin' star system.
third_cloned_system_found.0.non_natural=The third one? I have to admit, version with their natural origin looks less and less probable to me.
third_cloned_system_found.0.origin=And still no trace of who could have done it?
third_cloned_system_found.1=Haha, same to me
third_cloned_system_found.1.next=And still no trace of who can have don it?
third_cloned_system_found.2=No. This star system looks perfectly virgin, just like the others.
third_cloned_system_found.2.next=Maybe if we ask another races we will learn something about it. We can not be the first ones to notice it.
third_cloned_system_found.3=Yes, maybe. But they may require something in exchange for this information. I think we should look for others star systems like this, maybe we will find answer there.
third_cloned_system_found.3.end=Maybe...

weapon_test_report.0=So, captain, what are the results of the weapon test?
weapon_test_report.0.next=Our weapon failed to inflict any damage to alien ship
weapon_test_report.1=Any? What do you mean?
weapon_test_report.1.next='Any' means 'any'. Not a single scratch after the explosion. Than ship is perfectly shielded against any physical threat.
weapon_test_report.2=Too bad. We didn't expect that bomb to destroy it, but to make no damage at all... Then evacuation is the only choice.
weapon_test_report.2.next=Are we able to save everyone?
weapon_test_report.3=I don't think so. It will be very good if we manage to save enough to establish at least a small colony that can survive on its own. \n We will continue preparations, you are free for now.
weapon_test_report.3.next=<over>

aurora_probe_1.0=Captain, we have retrieved a probe. According to its ID, it is one of probes that were assigned to Aurora!
aurora_probe_1.0.data=Very good, maybe we have finally found a trail. Did you receive any data from it?
aurora_probe_1.0.ask=A probe?
aurora_probe_1.1=We have collected all astro data from probe, it was easy. But if we want to get other data, like log messages and transmission records, we will need more time to decrypt and decompress it. I have added this task to our list of research projects
aurora_probe_1.1.next=Very good, we will decode it when your department has free time
aurora_probe_1.2=Automated probe, there is a bunch of those on any ship. We also have a pack of them. Aurora captain must have left it here to collect astro data, and never returned
aurora_probe_1.2.next=I see. Did you extract anything valuable out of it?
aurora_probe_1.2.ask=Is it useful for us?
aurora_probe_1.3=At least it will contain collected astro data about this star system, we could use it instead of collecting on our own. And if we are lucky, it will contain some records from Aurora log concerning their current whereabouts
aurora_probe_1.3.next=I see. Did you extract anything valuable out of it?

aurora_probe_detected.0=Captain, we have detected a friendly signature in this star system! Most probably this is some piece of equipment from previous expeditions.
aurora_probe_detected.0.ok=Ok

rogue_beacon_found.0=Captain, we have detected two alien structures near this system's sun! The smaller one looks like it is some kind of defence drone and is guarding the larger one. And it has already targeted us! None of them responds to our hails. We should be careful.
rogue_beacon_found.0.peace=Ok, we will stay away from them and study from distance
rogue_beacon_found.0.war=Time to check our ship combat performance. Battle stations!

rogue_beacon_explored.0=Captain, we have sent landing parties to that huge alien structure. Our marines and scientists have successfully entered it and are now examining its internals. As soon as they return we will be able to study results.
rogue_beacon_explored.0.ok=Ok

planet_landing_tutorial.0=My boys are ready for our first deployment, captain. Just be sure to configure landing party properly before we move out. \n <Landing party configuration screen will open on first landing, and can be manually called by pressing 'e'>
planet_landing_tutorial.0.next=Do you have any suggestions about what landing party should be?
planet_landing_tutorial.0.end=Yes, I was just about to do this.
planet_landing_tutorial.1=Well, that depends on its tasks. All landing party members can perform all basic activities (combat, research and excavation), but they are much more efficient doing their own job. \n My marines are best at combat, while scientists - at researching artifacts. Engineers are the fastest in gathering resources.
planet_landing_tutorial.1.next=So basically even scientists can defend themselves?
planet_landing_tutorial.1.end=Ok, I'l take that to account.
planet_landing_tutorial.2=Yes. But they lack the combat skill and heavy weaponry. A single marine is roughly three times more efficient in combat than a civilian. Same ratio applies to other activities. \n Also, it is a question of honor for my guys to protect civilian members, even with their lives. So if casualties happen, marines usually sacrifice themselves first to protect others.
planet_landing_tutorial.2.next=I see. And how many people can we take to surface now?
planet_landing_tutorial.2.end=Ok, I'l take that to account.
planet_landing_tutorial.3=Currently, our landing shuttle can take 10 persons on board. In future perhaps it can be upgraded to greater capacity. \n So for unknown world I will recommend taking at least 4 marines and equal number of scientists and engineers.
planet_landing_tutorial.3.end=Ok, I'l take that to account.

repair_tutorial.0=We have suffered some bad damage here. You are the captain, of course, but I should have assigned someone for repairs already <press 'e' to view engineering screen after closing dialog window>
repair_tutorial.0.1=Thank you, Mira, I know what I am doing.
repair_tutorial.0.2=You are right, I will designate repair works ASAP.
