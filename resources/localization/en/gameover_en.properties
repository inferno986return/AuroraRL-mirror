ship_destroyed=Your ship is lost in deep space, a lifeless wreck floating around in the void. No one on Earth ever found out what really happened.
 
retire=You were fired from the captain's position and from Project Aurora.\n\
No one blamed you for your failure, and all your subsequent posts were honorable enough: you commanded good ships and good crews.\n\
But every time you see a research ship coming back from deep space, you cannot help but feel a pang of sadness and jealousy...

crew_lost=As the last crew member dies, your ship turns into a useless collection of scrap floating in the darkness.\
Its sophisticated mechanisms and computers will be around for millenia, still waiting for orders that no one will ever give.

commander_lost=You could not make it out of the mission alive. Leaving the ship and trying to do the landing party's job for it was,\
evidently, not your brightest idea. Now the future of humanity depends on others. Those who are still alive.

zorsan_captured_earth=Despite the humans' numerical superiority and desperate resistance, the Zorsan were able to completely conquer and subjugate\
the Earth after a few short days. What will happen to humanity now? We do not know.
