ship_destroyed=Your ship was lost in space, a lifeless hulk flying through the void. No one on Earth never learned what happened to you.

retire=You have been removed from commanding your ship and from Aurora project itself. \n\
No one blamed you for this failure, and your next assignments were good enough, fine ships under your command, but each time you saw Aurora ship on your radar, returning from deep space, you felt sadness and some times envy...
