ship_destroyed=Your ship was lost in space, a lifeless hulk flying through the void. No one on Earth never learned what happened to you.

retire=You have been removed from commanding your ship and from Aurora project itself. \n\

crew_lost=The last crew member is lost, and the ship is now no more than a lifeless hulk drifting in space, its machines waiting for new orders that will never be received.

commander_lost=You failed to get out of this alive. It was evidently a mistake to leave the ship and try to play hero. Now the future of humankind rests in hands of the other. Of those, who is still alive.
