nuclear_test_leaked.name=Утечка секретной информации - ядерные тесты в космосе!
nuclear_test_leaked.desc=Срочные новости! По информации, полученной нами от нашего источника в ОН, на корабли проекта Аврора устанавливают ядерное оружие. Возможно, они используются для проведения оружейных тестов в космосе, тем самым напрямую нарушая Акт о Чистом Космосе, подписанный всеми странами-членами ОН.\n\
Официальнх комментариев от специалистов проекта Аврора пока не поступало.

klisk_help_evac.name=Первые плоды межзвездной дипломатии.
klisk_help_evac.desc=Как было заявлено вчера, представители расы Клиск окажут помощь в развитии нашей новой колонии. Они предоставят транспорт для колонистов, а также определенную поддержку информацией и материалами. Это позволит значительно ускорить создание первого человеческого поселения за пределами Солнечной системы.

cancer_cure.name=Лекарство от рака пришло из космоса.
cancer_cure.desc=Как было объявлено на недавнем ежегодном научном конгрессе по межзвездной биологии, ученые обнаружили способ эффективной борьбы с раком. Особый тип имунных клеток, обнаруженный в одной из привезенных из космоса кораблем проекта Аврора форм жизни, способен эффективно уничтожать клетки опухолей. \n\
Ученые утверждают, что в ближайшее время смогут синтезировать подобные клетки, таким образом навсегда поборов этот недуг.

enterprise_1.name=At last
enterprise_1.desc=Hello! \n\
At last my time on Earth is over, they have finally finished building my ship and we are leaving in a couple of days. So don't think you will be ahead of your teacher anymore. And guess how they named her? Enterprise, like in that old movie, heh. \n\
So now we are joining you in your search. Looking forward to meet you in outer space, boy. \n\
Derek McCartney, captain of UNS Enterprise, can't stop laughing from that name.

enterprise_launch.name=Aurora project news: new ship launched
enterprise_launch.desc=A new ship from the Aurora project has been successfully launched this friday. It will explore new sector of galaxy near the Orion star system, its main objective is establishing diplomatic contacts with alien species in this region. \n\
Ship is called UNS Enterprise, based on hundreds of thousands pleas, received from Star Trek fans. It is the third ship in this series, capable of carrying up to a thousand crew members, scientists and explorers. \n\
It return is scheduled for autumn of a next year.

game_start.name=Good Luck
game_start.desc=Greetings.\n\
On behalf of Earth Command of Aurora space exploration project I whis you good luck in your mission. The fate of Earth, the future of humanity depends on heroes like you and your crew.\n\
A. V. Buren, Aurora CEO

game_start_2.name=Status Report
game_start_2.desc=Greetings. This is an automated message sent to you by UNS information center. All cargo loaded according to provided manifests and your ship is ready to launch at any time. Have a nice flight.\n\
Do not respond to this message.

icarus_0.name=Breakthrough in solar power usage?
icarus_0.desc=According to data stated in official Aurora project news, one of its ships has brought very valuable data conserning use of star enegry from its expedition. \n\
Data and technology acquired from an alien beacon-like structure can lead to a creation of much more effective ways of collecting and transfering solar power, which could give humanity so long anticipated 'free energy'. Scientists at Earth laboratories are now carefully studying retrieved material and are preparing official conclusion.

icarus_1.name=Good work
icarus_1.desc=Greetings.\n\
Perhaps you have heard already about the Icarus project? A few more years, and earth energy crisis will be over once and for ever. And this is done thanks to your effort. Good job, captain!\n\
A. V. Buren, Aurora CEO

icarus_2.name=Free energy tomorrow?
icarus_2.desc=The world scientific society is shocked by the discoveries done by analyzing materials retrieved from alien beacon by Aurora project ship, as they break all that we knew about using solar energy before. New discoveries has lead to creation of new cheap ways of extracting power from the Sun. \n\
As Earth energy reserves are nearly depleted, scientist use this new knowledge to present a solution. An Icarus project, a series of energy consuming space stations surrounding the Sun.\n\
Construction of the first one has already started.

icarus_3.name=First Icarus station launch
icarus_3.desc=The world holds breath while watching how first GW of energy are transferred from Icarus #1 station to earth. Though the launch of the station was postponed a couple of times, now it is finally launched and is producing power for Earth needs. \n\
Experts predict lowering of prices for energy by the end of the year by 15%, and cancelling of special power regulation laws in some most populated Earth regions.

icarus_4.name==Energy crisis gone, labor crisis coming?
icarus_4.desc=For the last months after Icarus power station has reached its full productivity, troubling news are coming from UN power plants and factories. Cheap solar energy has driven these structures obsolete. While ecologists and population praise Icarus project, power tycoons and workers hate it and try to sabotage building of new stations. \n\
Many people in energy production sector have lost their jobs. Strikes and uprisings happened in Russia, Egypt and some of european countries, which makes future of Icarus project unclear.

obliterator_discovered.name=Greatest known artificial structure discovered
obliterator_discovered.desc=UNS ship has encountered the biggest artificial structure ever seen by man in a distant star system. A huge object of unknown origin, larger than a star, can be seen on these amazing photos. Who has created it? What is its purpose? What power does it have? Read more in next issue of 'Galaxy News'.

evac_start.name=Colonization begins!
evac_start.desc=UN government together with Aurora project officials has made a long-expected announcement. Finally humanity begins interstellar colonization! \n\
Currently, everyone can make a request to enter the colonization program. Of course, preference is given to those who have good health and speciality, suitable for needs of a new colony. \n\
Colonization plan is scheduled for next 10 years, new interstellar ships are laid entirely for its purposes. First colony ship will leave shortly.

evac_start_2.name=Form #312-b [SECRET]
evac_start_2.desc=As a high-ranked Aurora project officer, you are allowed to select 2 other people that will be taken to a new colony. They are guaranteed a place on an evacuation ship. \n\
They must be no older than 45 years, be your first-order relatives (including wife and children) and pass a medical test. Please, fill attached form and submit it to Aurora Special Operations Desk. \n\
Remember, number of people we can save is heavily limited, so chose wisely. If you do not have any relatives you personally want to save, report this as soon as possible.
