        You are assigned as a captain on a third ship in  that series. Your primary goal is to bring back as much science data as possible.
You are free to choose any course for your ship and do whatever you believe is required to meet your objective.
Science society from Earth has collected a list of research tasks for your expedition. You can see them on your research screen tab (`r` by default). We recommend you to complete them, but of course its up to you to decide what you should do.
